It is very exciting that the preprint servers like arxiv and biorxiv are
rapidly gaining acceptance among the biologists. The process is being aided by
blogs highlighting interesting articles in different categories. Our reader

> im a huge fan of both the arXiv and bioRxiv, and have been posting on them
for a long time. I too struggle to get my biological collaborators (and even
some theoretical ones!) to post preprints for the same reasons you did. I
recently took a google poll about this and wrote about it here:

servers.html>

most of the real reasons behind not using the servers are just habits!!!

also, shameless plug, we mathematical oncology folks have a Haldanes Sieve
inspired blog too, and we definitely post bioRxiv pre-prints, its called
Warburgs Lens and can be found here:

cheers!
