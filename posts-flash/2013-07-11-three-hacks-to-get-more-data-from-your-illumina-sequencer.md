Biotechniques published an informative commentary for those looking for ways
to increase throughput from their Illumina machines.

Hack 1.

Illumina sequencers normally fragment DNA into short pieces before anchoring
it on the surface of the flowcell. This hack allows researchers to flow longer
pieces of DNA onto the flowcell, performing the final library preparation
steps in the flowcell itself, in order to get sequence information the most
cost-efficiently from long molecules instead of short.

Hack 2.

High-throughput sequencing-fluorescent ligand interaction profiling, or HiTS-
FLIP for short. Basically, adding fluorescently-tagged proteins directly to an
Illumina flowcell to analyze protein-DNA interactions.

Hack 3.

Lane-by-lane sequencing with an Illumina Genome Analyzer II. Modifications
allow researchers to use the GAII with fewer than the standard eight lanes.

work, and who discovered them.
