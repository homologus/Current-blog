In the context of "[GATK Battle 2015
Edition](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/blog/2015/04/08/gatk-
battle-2015-edition/)", I requested Ruibang Luo, the first author of [BALSA
paper](https://peerj.com/articles/421/), to send me some comparative stats of
BALSA vs GATK.

Apparently, the [GCAT site at
Bioplanet](http://www.bioplanet.com/gcat/reports/5236-lyjfvvatdd/variant-calls
/illumina-100bp-pe-exome-150x/balsa-gcat-illumina-150x/compare-571-2319/group-
read-depth) hosts such a comparison open to everyone. By going through the
charts, I do not see any qualitative difference between the two programs. In
other words, if someone removed the program names from the website and asked
me to find GATK from the comparative charts, I could not have done so.

Here is one of the comparative charts [among many in their
site](http://www.bioplanet.com/gcat/reports/5236-lyjfvvatdd/variant-calls
/illumina-100bp-pe-exome-150x/balsa-gcat-illumina-150x/compare-571-2319/group-
read-depth) \-

Given that BALSA runs way faster, produces results as good as GATK and comes
at no cost, it is unclear to me why people would pay so much for GATK. One
quoted number I saw in twitter was ~$40K/license (!!!), although the others
said the actual price is 'not that high'.
