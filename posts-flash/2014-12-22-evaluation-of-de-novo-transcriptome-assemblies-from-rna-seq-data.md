> De novo RNA-Seq assembly facilitates the study of transcriptomes for species
without sequenced genomes, but it is challenging to select the most accurate
assembly in this context. To address this challenge, we developed a model-
based score, RSEM-EVAL, for evaluating assemblies when the ground truth is
unknown. We show that RSEM-EVAL correctly reflects assembly accuracy, as
measured by REF-EVAL, a refined set of ground-truth-based scores that we also
developed. Guided by RSEM-EVAL, we assembled the transcriptome of the
regenerating axolotl limb; this assembly compares favorably to a previous
assembly. A software package implementing our methods, DETONATE, is freely
available at http://deweylab.biostat.wisc.edu/detonate.
