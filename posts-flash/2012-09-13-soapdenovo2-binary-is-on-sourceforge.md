BGI released the program at SourceForge. We received this email from BGI today
-

> Dear All,

We've uploaded the binaries of SOAPdenovo2 to the SourceForge. Please visit
link "http://sourceforge.net/projects/soapdenovo2" or search "SOAPdenovo2" in
SourceForge.

Before the formal publish of SOAPdenovo2, it's recommended to cite both the
SourceForge website and the paper of the first version of SOAPdenovo to use
SOAPdenovo2 in your study.

For any question, please do not hesitate to create a thread in the forum in
the website and we will reply as soon as possible.

We were mistaken about release of source code, because the name of the site is
'SourceForge', not BinaryForge. Something got 'lost in translation' :)
