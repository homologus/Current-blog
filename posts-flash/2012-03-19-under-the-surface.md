post a commentary here.

Although we were almost silent over the last two weeks, many changes were
taking place beneath the surface to help you get more from our website.

You probably noticed two buttons 'search' and 'trends' on the top of the site.

This is where we would like to give you access to available transcriptome data
from around the globe. At this moment, our focus is on the NCBI GEO and SRA
databases, two large warehouses for publicly available transcriptome data.
Previously the data supporting those two links had been stale from last year,
but we uploaded the latest data, and wrote a full pipeline to keep data
synchronized with NCBI.

In the 'Trends' section, we show you global trends of GEO and SRA submissions.
Everyone is busy with his own research, but this is where you can have a
global view of what others are doing. We have been watching those charts for
some time and noticed few interesting patterns that we plan to talk about in
our future commentaries.

In the 'Search' box, you can type something like 'GPL570' or 'rat circudian'
and can get names of all GEO submissions related to your search words. We
understand that it is not too much information at this moment, but we are
expecting to improve the 'search' routine to bring lot more to you.

Oh, we have not given up on thinking, reading and writing about cool NGS
algorithms, Hadoop, Trinity, Velvet, Bowtie, etc. We do have few surprises for
you in that front as well.

Stay tuned !!
