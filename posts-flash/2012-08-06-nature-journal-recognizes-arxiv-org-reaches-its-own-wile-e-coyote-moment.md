[A column in Nature News](http://www.nature.com/news/geneticists-eye-the-
potential-of-arxiv-1.11091) comments on the recent surge in acceptance of
[arXiv.org](http://arxiv.org/) among the geneticists. We wonder why it took
the biology community so long to embrace truly open publishing.

The website arxiv.org was developed in 1991 by Cornell theoretical physicist
[Paul Ginsparg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Ginsparg), who started it as
a small unfunded project in addition to his own research. The side activity
became so popular among physicists that, around mid-90s, US government decided
to fund Ginsparg to develop it further.

We came to learn about arxiv.org in 1995-1996 as young graduate students
working on condensed matter physics. Convincing our professor to put
unpublished papers in a 'fringe' website was indeed a hard sell. We tried all
possible arguments ('increasing visibility', 'you get cited, not scooped'
etc.) without success. Finally, a friendly article in Physics Today and NSF's
decision to fund the project to bring it mainstream changed his mind.

Why is arxiv.org so successful? It is simply because the preprint server is
swimming with the tide. Let us explain.

The word 'publish' means presenting something to the public. In a long gone
era, Martin Luther ['published'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ninety-
Five_Theses) his ninety five theses by nailing them on the door of Castle
Church of Wittenberg. In the same vain, if all geneticists of the world lived
in a small town on California coast and went to the same coffee shop every
day, posting a research article on its bulletin board would have been enough
evidence of publication of a discovery.

Our world is far more complex leading to modern norms of publication in well-
circulated journals. Historically, established journals like Nature and
Science started between 1860-1880, when industrial revolution allowed mass
production and circulation of popular magazines, newspapers and scientific
journals. With increasing interest in science among people, many other
journals were created afterward to cover topics of special interest.

From the advent of industrial revolution to mid-1990s, scientists had only two
inexpensive ways to reach wide audience - (i) oral presentation at a
conference, (ii) publication in a journal. Among those two, the words spoken
in oral presentations could be 'changed on a dime'. Moreover, those words were
not accessible to scientists not attending a specific conference. So,
presenting in print media was the only way to make sure the results of
research were known to public or were 'published'.

All that changed with the arrival of internet. Internet allows global
dissemination of research results at a fraction of cost compared to print
media. Moreover, internet has many advantages that the print media cannot
replicate. For example, scientists can communicate through [mailing
lists](http://seqanswers.com/), [blogs](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/2012/07/27
/how-to-stay-current-in-bioinformaticsgenomics/),
[github](https://github.com/ctb/khmer) and even
[twitter](https://twitter.com/#!/homolog_us/). Do we really need the print
media?

To explain how effective the internet is in disseminating scientific
information, the authors of [Velvet
assembler](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~zerbino/velvet/) wrote another program named
[Oases](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~zerbino/oases/) for transcriptome assembly. The
program is freely available from public repository and has been used by
hundreds of researchers. From that viewpoint, the program was published on the
very day it was uploaded to github. It is being further developed by an active
community of bioinformaticians, who keep in touch through a mailing list. The
above process built stronger credibility for Oases than its eventual
'publication' [in a print journal](http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/co
ntent/early/2012/02/24/bioinformatics.bts094.abstract). Similarly, [UCSC
genome browser](http://genome.ucsc.edu/) is a different form of publication,
and users learn about it by using the website, not by reading about it in
paper published in print journal.

Print journals continue to claim relevance by giving clear time-stamp to
papers, and that is where the beauty of arxiv.org is seen. A paper uploaded to
arxiv.org also gets a specific time-stamp. The paper can be edited further,
and various edits are kept separately. You can see an example
[here](http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/9606065) from one of our earlier
publications in 1996. The paper was updated four times and arxiv.org preserved
all its history.

One line of criticism often made against arxiv.org in the early days turned
out to be baseless. It was the issue of lack of editors and reviewers for the
e-journal. Arxiv.org has a process of self-selection, by which the community
'accepts' good papers by citing them more and 'rejects' bad papers by ignoring
them. Eventually, PLOS One followed similar model, but arxiv.org came at the
right price ($0.000) compared to PLOS One ($1000). Still, both are well ahead
of the Nature journal, which charges a reader [$32 to let them read only the
Trinity paper](http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v29/n7/full/nbt.1883.html).

If the above trend of publishing in preprint servers take hold, it will
destroy the business model of print biology journals with high cost of access.
Why will a smart researcher pay premium price to a journal, when his paper
collects all citations based on its arxiv.org postings? Moreover, we
anticipate that medical research community will [experience significant cuts
in funding in the coming years](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/2012/08/02
/biggest-headwind-against-personalized-medicine/), and will fully embrace
arxiv.org, just like the physicists did in early 90s after governments
dramatically reduced funding for nuclear research.
