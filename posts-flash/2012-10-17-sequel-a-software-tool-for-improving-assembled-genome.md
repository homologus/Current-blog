is a nice paper that can help those working on notoriously difficult single-
cell genome assemblies. Not only the application is useful, the positional de
Bruijn Graph method appears interesting as well and can be adapted for other
purposes.

> SEQuel reduced the number of small insertions and deletions in the
assemblies of standard multi-cell Escherichia coli data by almost half, and
corrected between 30% and 94% of the substitution errors. Further, we show
SEQuel is imperative to improving single-cell assembly, which is inherently
more challenging due to higher error rates and non-uniform coverage; over half
of the small indels, and substitution errors in the single-cell assemblies
were corrected. We apply SEQuel to the recently assembled Deltaproteobacterium
SAR324 genome, which is the first bacterial genome with a comprehensive
single-cell genome assembly, and make over 800 changes (insertions, deletions
and substitutions) to refine this assembly.
