Our reader [Robert alerted us](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/software/2013/06/16
/biostar-comments-from-khader-shameer/) about a tutorial website he put
together that you may find helpful.

> Ive put together a tutorial website with four core tutorials on it, RNA-Seq,
ChIP-Seq, Genome assembly, and SNP calling.

This website was created to share bioinformatics tutorials and create a
dynamic learning environment that does not become dated, PDF contributions
welcome and there are four core tutorials available. Although not on biostar,
I would be interested to get some feedback.
