> We have been hard at work in the studio putting together our next
specialization to launch on Coursera. It will be called the "Genomic Data
Science Specialization" and includes a spectacular line up of instructors:
Steven Salzberg, Ela Pertea, James Taylor, Liliana Florea, Kasper Hansen, and
me. The specialization will cover command line tools, statistics, Galaxy,
Bioconductor, and Python. There will be a capstone course at the end of the
sequence featuring an in-depth genomic analysis. If you are a grad student,
postdoc, or principal investigator in a group that does genomics this
specialization is for you. If you are a person looking to transition into one
of the hottest areas of research with the new precision medicine initiative
this is for you. Get pumped and share the teaser-trailer with your friends!
