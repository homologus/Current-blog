[Here](http://simonsfoundation.org/features/science-news/unheralded-
mathematician-bridges-the-prime-gap/) is one of the coolest stories reported
this week (h/t: @DanGraur).

> On April 17, a paper arrived in the inbox of Annals of Mathematics, one of
the disciplines preeminent journals. Written by a mathematician virtually
unknown to the experts in his field a 50-something lecturer at the University
of New Hampshire named Yitang Zhang the paper claimed to have taken a huge
step forward in understanding one of mathematics oldest problems, the twin
primes conjecture.

Editors of prominent mathematics journals are used to fielding grandiose
claims from obscure authors, but this paper was different. Written with
crystalline clarity and a total command of the topics current state of the
art, it was evidently a serious piece of work, and the Annals editors decided
to put it on the fast track.

Just three weeks later a blink of an eye compared to the usual pace of
mathematics journals Zhang received the referee report on his paper.

The main results are of the first rank, one of the referees wrote. The author
had proved a landmark theorem in the distribution of prime numbers.

The discovery was surprising for several reasons. It is usually believed that
if a mathematician does not shine by age 30, he will never shine. In contrast,
Yitang Zhang was over 50. Moreover, he did not come up with a completely new
way to solve the problem, but continued on a path that other established
mathematicians discarded.
