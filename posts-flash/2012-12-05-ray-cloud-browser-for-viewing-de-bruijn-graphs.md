Sbastien Boisvert, the author of [Ray Genome
Assembler](http://denovoassembler.sourceforge.net/), developed a cool browser
for de Bruin graphs that you may check out
[here](http://ec2-54-242-197-219.compute-1.amazonaws.com/~sebhtml/Ray-Cloud-
Browser/client/) !! The code is animated and allows you to drag the nodes
around, move left and right along the sequence and do many other fun things.

Github source for his browser is available [here](https://github.com/sebhtml
