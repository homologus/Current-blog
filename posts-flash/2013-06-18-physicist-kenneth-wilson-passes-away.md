and we fully agree. Very rarely physicists are awarded Nobel prize for
mathematically beautiful theories, Wilson's [renormalization
group](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renormalization_group) being an exception.
[Renormalization group touches every branch of theoretical
physics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renormalization_group), because it
connects physics of the last few centuries (linear theories + perturbation)
with physics of possibly the next few centuries (nonlinearity, self
similarity, fractal).

Yet when we search for Ken Wilson in google, everyone from a sportcaster and
car dealer to a [high class thief](http://blogs.wsj.com/deals/2008/07/21/ken-
wilson-the-goldman-sachs-man-behind-your-bailouts/) comes in the top page, but
not the brilliant physicist. You do not find him until you use the full name
Kenneth Wilson. That is nearly as tragic as his passing away.
