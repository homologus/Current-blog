Regarding assembly strategy, Dr. Cox told me -

> Parsimonious adapter trim then Velvet, making best use of lesser-known
Velvet options. Hope to release as BaseSpace app soon.

Readers curious about relative performance of Velvet vs other assemblers will
find the [benchmarking table at the SPAdes
website](http://bioinf.spbau.ru/spades) helpful. SPAdes group also releases
their assembler as an app in BaseSpace.

Others with more direct experience with the topic please chime in.
