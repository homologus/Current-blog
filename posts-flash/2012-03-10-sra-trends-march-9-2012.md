We updated the [SRA charts in our Trends
section](http://www.homolog.us/CI/index.php/charts/growth_sra) with the latest
data. The last update was made on August 28, 2011 as we reported
[here](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/2011/08/28/geo-and-sra-quarterly-growth-in-
transcriptomic-research/).

SRA has seen phenomenal growth over the last 6 years. Total number of
submissions went up from 7240 in August to 10193 today. That is a gain of 40%.
The number of transcriptome-related entries went up from 1078 to 1643 (52%
gain).

Here are the quarterly breakdowns of SRA submissions as it stands today. The
first chart shows all submissions including genomic and transcriptomic
experiments, whereas the second chart shows only transcriptome-related
submissions. The exponential trend observed before Q4 2010 did not come back
after 2010.
