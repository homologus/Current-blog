Almost everyone learning graph algorithms or combinatorics soon comes across
[Seven Bridges of Knigsberg
problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Bridges_of_K%C3%B6nigsberg) solved
by Euler and the [BEST theorem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BEST_theorem).
[Leonhard Euler](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler) was the greatest
mathematician of modern era, and definitely the most productive one publishing
close to 900 books. Physicist Richard Feynman [described Euler formula of
complex numbers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_formula) as "one of
the most remarkable, almost astounding, formulas in all of mathematics."

Interestingly, his [productivity seem to have increased after he became
blind](http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2010/apr/11/the-10-best-
mathematicians) at age 50.

Readers may enjoy 'daily blog posts' written by Euler, while tutoring a German
princess. They are compiled in [Letters of Euler on different Subjects in
Natural Philosophy Addressed to a German
Princess](http://archive.org/details/lettersofeuleron02eule).
