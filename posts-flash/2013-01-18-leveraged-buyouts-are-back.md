[Dell Leveraged Buyout May Hinge on Cash Hoard Outside
U.S.](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-18/dell-leveraged-buyout-may-
hinge-on-cash-hoard-outside-u-s-.html)

> Michael Dells plan to take his computer company Dell Inc. (DELL) private may
hinge in part on whether hes able to exploit one of the companys most valuable
assets: as much as $14.2 billion of cash and bonds outside the U.S.

Like many of the worlds largest technology companies, Dell has legally avoided
billions of dollars in income taxes by attributing profits to overseas
subsidiaries in tax havens. Bringing the cash back to the U.S. to finance the
buyout would risk subjecting the money to the 35 percent corporate income tax
rate, with a credit for any foreign income tax theyve already paid.

Who holds the bag after leveraged buyouts? Answer - Pension funds.
