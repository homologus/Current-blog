> A number of technologies have emerged for accelerating similarity search
algorithms in bioinformatics, including the use of field programmable gate
arrays (FPGA), graphics processing units (GPU), and clusters of standard
multicore CPUs. Here we present Tera-BLAST, an FPGA-accelerated implementation
of the BLAST algorithm, and compare the performance to GPU-accelerated BLAST
and the industry standard NCBI BLAST+ on high performance computers. Our
results show that Tera-BLAST, running on the TimeLogic J-series FPGA
Similarity Search Engine, performs 100s of times faster than BLAST running on
generic NVIDIA Tesla M2090 GPU cards or standard Intel Xeon multi-core CPUs.
