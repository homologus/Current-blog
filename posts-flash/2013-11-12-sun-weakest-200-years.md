[Sun hits weakest cycle in '200
years'](http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/wall-street-journal/sun-hits-
weakest-cycle-in-200-years/story-fnay3ubk-1226758499562#)

> "I would say it is the weakest in 200 years," said David Hathaway, head of
the solar physics group at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville,
Ala.

Researchers are puzzled. They can't tell if the lull is temporary or the onset
of a decades-long decline, which might ease global warming a bit by altering
the sun's brightness or the wavelengths of its light.

"There is no scientist alive who has seen a solar cycle as weak as this one,"
said Andrs Munoz-Jaramillo, who studies the solar-magnetic cycle at the
Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass.

Wall street journal carries the same story, but the title appears to be 'too
strong' for American people :)

The good news is that solar activity has no bearing on the temperature of the
earth :). How can that be? Surely we jest ! Here is a chart showing 400 years
of variations in solar activity.

The low around 1650 coincides with the climactic minima of little ice age,
when the sea between Sweden and Denmark froze allowing the Swedish king to
attack Copenhaven by walking on the frozen sea. Here is a picture of frozen
Thames from 1677. Sun matters to the real world dwellers, even though that
yellow ball is not part of any contemporary climate models.
