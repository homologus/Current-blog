Part 1 - Larger Perspective

Part 2 Trinity and Oases Quick Start Guide

Part 3 Assembly Algorithms of Trinity and Oases

Part 4 Tricks and Tips for Better Results

If you are in a hurry, I also [reported an
example](http://www.homolog.us/smf/index.php?topic=23.0) of our experience
with trinity assembler in the forum. It discusses how to run the program,
gives some estimates on how much time the program takes to run, RAM size,
explains the directory structures, etc.
