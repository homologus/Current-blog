The world of bioinformatics did not stand still, while we were away. Thanks to
twitter, catching up is lot easier than the past.

Here is a summary of important releases -

(i) Very cool - [Using Next-gen Sequencing to Unravel Outbreaks of Infectious
Disease ](http://www.nature.com/news/dna-sequencers-stymie-superbug-
spread-1.11808)

(ii) [Genome-guided Trinity - a cufflink
alternative?](http://trinityrnaseq.sourceforge.net/genome_guided_trinity.html)
(ht: @genetic_blog)

(iii) [Minia](http://minia.genouest.org/) is now open source. Thanks Rayan.

(iv) [Cortex variation assembler](http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/con
tent/early/2012/11/19/bioinformatics.bts673.short?rss=1) (ht: CTB) -

> We have developed a software package, Cortex, designed for the analysis of
genetic variation by de novo assembly of multiple samples. This allows direct
comparison of samples without using a reference genome as intermediate, and
incorporates discovery and genotyping of SNPs, indels and larger events in a
single framework.

(v) A good discussion on [nanopore sequencing at reddit](http://www.reddit.com
/r/bioinformatics/comments/1321ab/thoughts_on_nanoporeseq/) (ht: Jason Chin)

(vi) We are not sure, whether we posted about this before. BGI developed
method for incorporating [very long PE reads](http://www.plosone.org/article/i
nfo%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0046211).

(vii) [How much sequencing is needed for de novo
assembly?](http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/how-much-sequencing-is-needed.html)
(blog post from C. Titus Brown).

(viii) [Is $1000 genome a bait-and-switch?](http://www.genomeweb.com/blog/1000
-genome-bait-and-switch)

(ix) [Illumina 150PE Rocks](http://macmanes.com/blog/?p=87), while

[Helicos files for bankruptcy](http://www.chapter11blog.com/chapter11/2012/11
/helicos-biosciences-corporation-files-for-chapter-11.html). Also see
[here](http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/battered-helicos-files-
for-chapter-11/81247649/).

(ix) Two interesting articles on changing how scientists communicate -

[Scientific Utopia: I. Opening scientific
communication](http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.1055)

[Scientific Utopia: II. Restructuring incentives and practices to promote
truth over publishability](http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.4251)
