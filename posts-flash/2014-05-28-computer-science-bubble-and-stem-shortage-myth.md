It is even more disconcerting that -

> One needs to keep in mind here that the last time enrollment in computer
science peaked was in the year 2000 concurrently with the technology mania.
This is obviously no coincidence. What is slightly disconcerting is that the
current peak in enrollments towers vastly above that previous bubble peak.

In [Malinvestment in Human Capital](http://www.acting-man.com/?p=30820),
acting-man blog explains why the current trend is a bubble and we agree.

On the bigger topic of STEM skill shortage, Mish explains why it is a myth -

[Is There a Shortage of Skilled Workers? My Own Personal
Experiences](http://globaleconomicanalysis.blogspot.com/2014/05/is-there-
shortage-of-skilled-workers-my.html)

> The idea that a "middle-skilled" person can go back to school at age 40,
take a few classes and become a java programmer, an engineer, or a chef, and
land a meaningful job in that field is nothing but hope-filled hype. Perhaps 1
out of 100 make some use of their training. The rest just end up deeper in
debt.

But there is more.

[US Government Proposes To Ease Student Loan Standards Even
Further](http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2014-05-27/us-government-proposes-ease-
student-loan-standards-even-further)

> Parents whose financial standing disqualify them from most loans may have an
easier time borrowing to pay their childrens college costs under a U.S.
government proposal to ease credit standards.

We hope intelligent readers will connect the dots and manage their lives
accordingly.
