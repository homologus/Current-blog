Pacbio launched a new instrument called 'Sequel'. Here are the relevant
numbers -
<!--more-->

**Price:**

"The U.S. list price for the Sequel System is **$350,000**. It is currently
available for Research Use Only."

\--------------------------------------

**Throughput:**

"The core of the Sequel System is the capacity of its redesigned SMRT Cells,
which contain **one million zero-mode waveguides (ZMWs) at launch, compared to
150,000 ZMWs in the PacBio RS II.**"

\-------------------------------------

**Size of instrument:**

"The Sequel System occupies a smaller footprint **less than one-third the size
and weight** compared to the PacBio RS II."

Full press release is available [here](http://finance.yahoo.com/news/pacific-
biosciences-launches-sequencing-platform-201500676.html).

I have been trying to do some back-of-the-envelope calculation of how much it
would cost to assemble human-sized genomes with the new instrument and get
less than $1000. Is that right?
