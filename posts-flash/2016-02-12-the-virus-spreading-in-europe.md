[Max Delbrck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Delbr%C3%BCck), together with
Luria and Hershey, received Nobel prize in 1969 "for their discoveries
concerning the replication mechanism and the genetic structure of viruses".

Delbrck had another connection with a virus that is currently spreading fast
in Europe. His [grandfather's
brother](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelbert_Delbr%C3%BCck) founded
Deutsche bank ~150 years back. Europe's largest bank is now in trouble, and is
in desperate need of bail-out/bail-in. Moreover, when the largest European
bank goes down, that event has the potential to take down several other banks.
In the worst case, the entire global and interconnected banking system can
experience 'blue screen of death' on some sunny day. No wonder, central
bankers are panicking again.

Of course, failure of the largest bank is what Europe needs at this moment.
