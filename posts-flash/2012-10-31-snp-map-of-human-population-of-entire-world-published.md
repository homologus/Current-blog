[An integrated map of genetic variation from 1,092 human genomes](http://www.n

<!--more-->

The study combined low-coverage genome sequencing and exome sequencing from 14
population from Europe (CEU, TSI, GBR, FIN and IBS), Africa (YRI, LWK and
ASW), East Asia (CHB, JPT and CHS) and the Americas (MXL, CLM and PUR).

> Population abbreviations: ASW, people with African ancestry in Southwest
United States; CEU, Utah residents with ancestry from Northern and Western
Europe; CHB, Han Chinese in Beijing, China; CHS, Han Chinese South, China;
CLM, Colombians in Medellin, Colombia; FIN, Finnish in Finland; GBR, British
from England and Scotland, UK; IBS, Iberian populations in Spain; LWK, Luhya
in Webuye, Kenya; JPT, Japanese in Tokyo, Japan; MXL, people with Mexican
ancestry in Los Angeles, California; PUR, Puerto Ricans in Puerto Rico; TSI,
Toscani in Italia; YRI, Yoruba in Ibadan, Nigeria. Ancestry-based groups: AFR,
African; AMR, Americas; EAS, East Asian; EUR, European.

Major finding? Successful cloning of Evan Eichler at University of Washington.
