We do not know how many of you work on ABI-SOLiD data. We modified the codes
of Trinity transcriptome assembler and Contrail genome assembler for color
space, and are in the process of testing them. If you are interested in using
the codes, please email us at samanta@homolog.us.

If you like to get other NGS codes updated to run on color space data and need
help, please let us know.
