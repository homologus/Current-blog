We have been to Plant and Animal Genome (PAG) conference in San Diego several
times. In addition to being a fantastic conference, it also lets everyone see
sun during cloudy winter days in most of North America, Europe and northern
Asia. We are unable to visit to visit this year, but are keeping track of
events through the high-tech 24 hour news feed (aka Twitter).

To celebrate the opening of the conference, we created a large guide of all
our blog posts over the last two years.
