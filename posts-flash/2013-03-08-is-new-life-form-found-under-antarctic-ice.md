Two months back, we commented on a successful mission by Russians to collect
water from a lake long buried under Antarctic ice -

Now it seems like they have indeed [found a new kind of bacterial
life](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/mar/08/scientists-bacterial-life-

> An enormous lake that has lain buried under Antarctic ice for millions of
years is home to a new kind of bacterial life, Russian scientists claim.

The researchers found evidence for the unidentified organism in water samples
brought up from Lake Vostok, the largest subglacial lake on the Antarctic
continent.

The Russian team found seven samples of the mystery species in water that had
frozen on a drill head used to reach the lake that lies beneath an ice sheet
more than two miles (3.5km) thick.

The scientists extracted strands of DNA from the organism, but said the
genetic code was never more than an 86% match with any of the species listed
in global databanks. Sergey Bulat, a researcher on the team at the Petersburg
Nuclear Physics Institute, said that anything less than a 90% match usually
indicated that the organism was unknown.

"We call it unidentified and 'unclassified' life," Bulat told the state news
agency, RIA Novosti. "If it were found on Mars, people would call it Martian
DNA. But this is DNA from Earth," he added.

Would our readers from St. Petersburg shed any more light on the discovery?
