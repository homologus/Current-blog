Several eons ago, we reviewed ["Algorithms for Constructing of Phylogenetic
Network (Reticulate Evolution)"](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/blog/2014/04/30

> Construction of phylogenetic trees and networks for extant species from
their characters represents one of the key problems in phylogenomics. While
solution to this problem is not always uniquely defined and there exist
multiple methods for tree/network construction, it becomes important to
measure how well constructed networks capture the given character relationship
across the species.

In the current study, we propose a novel method for measuring the specificity
of a given phylogenetic network in terms of the total number of distributions
of character states at the leaves that the network may impose. While for
binary phylogenetic trees, this number has an exact formula and depends only
on the number of leaves and character states but not on the tree topology, the
situation is much more complicated for non-binary trees or networks.
Nevertheless, we develop an algorithm for combinatorial enumeration of such
distributions, which is applicable for arbitrary trees and networks under some
reasonable assumptions.
