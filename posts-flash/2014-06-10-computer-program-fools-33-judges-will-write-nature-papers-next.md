> A computer pretending to be 'Eugene Goostman', a 13-year old boy fooled 33%
of human judge interrogators into thinking it is human.

It was from a story reported in Guardian.

A "super computer" has duped humans into thinking it was a 13-year-old boy to
become the first machine to pass the Turing test, experts have said. Five
machines were tested at the Royal Society in central London to see if they
could fool people into thinking they were humans during text-based
conversations.

The test was devised in 1950 by computer science pioneer and second world war
codebreaker Alan Turing, who said that if a machine was indistinguishable from
a human, then it was "thinking".

Is such a computer program useful? Mish argued -

a lot easier than tricking a panel of humans that a computer was a 30 year-old
man.

...but there is a way out. We are wondering, whether it can be utilized to
generate high profile papers in human genomics. After all, the ENCODE
experience has shown that sending textbook-altering papers to Nature editors
is possibly an easy task worthy of such a computer program.
