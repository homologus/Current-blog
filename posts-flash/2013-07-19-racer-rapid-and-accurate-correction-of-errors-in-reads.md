> Motivation: High throughput next generation sequencing technologies enable
increasingly fast and affordable sequencing of genomes and transcriptomes,
with a broad range of applications. The quality of the sequencing data is
crucial for all applications. A significant portion of the data produced
contains errors and ever more efficient error correction programs are needed.

Results: We propose RACER (Rapid and Accurate Correction of Errors in Reads),
a new software program for correcting errors in sequencing data. RACER has
better error correcting performance than existing programs, is faster, and
requires less memory. To support our claims, we performed extensive comparison
with the existing leading programs on a variety of real datasets.
