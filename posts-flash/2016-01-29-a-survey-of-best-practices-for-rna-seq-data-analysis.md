title: A survey of best practices for RNA-seq data analysis
categories:
- rnaseq

> RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) has a wide variety of applications, but no single
analysis pipeline can be used in all cases. We review all of the major steps
in RNA-seq data analysis, including experimental design, quality control, read
alignment, quantification of gene and transcript levels, visualization,
differential gene expression, alternative splicing, functional analysis, gene
fusion detection and eQTL mapping. We highlight the challenges associated with
each step. We discuss the analysis of small RNAs and the integration of RNA-
seq with other functional genomics techniques. Finally, we discuss the outlook
for novel technologies that are changing the state of the art in
transcriptomics.
