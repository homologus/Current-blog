I have been reading the book [Genetics and the Logic of
Evolution](http://www.amazon.com/Genetics-Logic-Evolution-Kenneth-Weiss/dp/047
1238058/ref=la_B001H6N9PE_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1411586567&sr=1-2) by Ken
Weiss and Anne Buchanan, and found it thought-provoking. The impatient readers
are encouraged to first take a look at this 2005 review paper, which presents
their ideas in condensed form -

Our regular readers are already familiar with their excellent blog - ['The
Mermaid's Tale'](http://ecodevoevo.blogspot.com/) named after [their later
book](http://www.amazon.com/Mermaids-Tale-Billion-Cooperation-Making/dp/067403
1938/ref=la_B001H6N9PE_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1411586567&sr=1-1), which
covers topics similar to 'Genetics and the Logic of Evolution'.

Today's blog post is about a Penn State presentation, where professor Weiss
discussed the extent by which complex diseases are 'controlled' through our
genomes. Before listening to the entire talk, please fast forward to 46:00,
where he showed the roles of genes and environment. The following figure
presents the risk of breast cancer by age group of those born in USA before
1940s and after 1940s. If the genomes did not change, isn't the dramatic rise
in risk entirely due to environment? He presented a test case from Finland
that suggests so.
