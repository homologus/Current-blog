> Despite tremendous body form diversity in nature, bilaterian animals share
common sets of developmental genes that display conserved expression patterns
in the embryo. Among them are the Hox genes, which define different identities
along the anterior posterior axis. Hox proteins exert their function by
interaction with TALE transcription factors. Hox and TALE members are also
present in some but not all non-bilaterian phyla, raising the question of how
Hox TALE interactions evolved to provide positional information. By using
proteins from unicellular and multicellular lineages, we showed that these
networks emerged from an ancestral generic motif present in Hox and other
related protein families. Interestingly, Hox-TALE networks experienced
additional and extensive molecular innovations that were likely crucial for
differentiating Hox functions along body plans. Together our results highlight
how homeobox gene families evolved during eukaryote evolution to eventually
constitute a major patterning system in Eumetazoans.
