> Genome assembly projects typically run multiple algorithms in an attempt to
find the single best assembly, although those assemblies often have
complementary, if untapped, strengths and weaknesses. We present our
metassembler algorithm that merges multiple assemblies of a genome into a
single superior sequence. We apply it to the four genomes from the
Assemblathon competitions and show it consistently and substantially improves
the contiguity and quality of each assembly. We also develop guidelines for
metassembly by systematically evaluating 120 permutations of merging the top 5
assemblies of the first Assemblathon competition. The software is open-source
at http://metassembler.sourceforge.net.
