NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Nobel Prize medal won by Francis Crick, the co-
discoverer of DNA, sold for $2.27 million at auction on Thursday, a day after
a letter in which Crick outlined the achievement to his young son became the
most expensive letter ever auctioned when it fetched more than $6 million.

...

Crick's Nobel medal sold for $2,270,500, Heritage Auctions said, or more than
four times the pre-sale estimate. It did not identify the buyer.

....

On Wednesday, the price of a seven-page handwritten letter from 1953 in which
Crick, then 33, described the discovery to his young son who was away at
boarding school, soared to $6,059,750 when it was auctioned at Christie's.

.....

Christie's had estimated the Crick letter, which was being sold by Crick's
son, would sell for between $1 million and $2 million. In it, Crick wrote that
he believed DNA is a code and that the order of the bases (the letters) makes
one gene different from another.

Crick went on to work as a professor at the Salk Institute for Biological
Studies in La Jolla, California, and died in 2004.

It does not sound like a happy story despite all those million dollar numbers
mentioned here and there. Everything is for sell these days. What happened to
family honor?
