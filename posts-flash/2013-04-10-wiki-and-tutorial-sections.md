[Our wiki section](http://homolog.us/wiki1/index.php?title=Main_Page), where
we [worked through the SOAPdenovo
code](http://homolog.us/wiki1/index.php?title=SOAPdenovo2), became a victim of
spam attack. We earlier kept the 'register and modify' option open so that
other readers could join us to work through various codes. The spammers took
the opportunity and posted on cheapest mortgage products and other exciting
topics !!

The condition became so bad that we decided to reinstall the wiki and port
good pages from old wiki. Hyperlink to the new wiki is at 'wiki1' instead
'wiki'. We tried to fix as many blog hyperlinks as we could, but the task is
not complete yet.

If you like to modify the wiki, please feel free to email me for an account at
samanta at homolog.us. We will continue to work through other codes, as time
permits.

\-----------------------------

The [entry page of the tutorial section](http://www.homolog.us/Tutorials/) was
also modified to make room for three other sets of new tutorials.

The de Bruijn graph tutorial stays where it is, whereas the new material will
be added as soon as we manage to make them presentable. If you like to speed
up the process or enjoy our commentaries, please do not shy away from pressing
the donate button on the right sidebar of this page. We like to keep this
project independent of all kinds of government funding so that we can continue
to seek truth in science.
