Dear Readers, Today we came to know that Lex Nederbragt's group's request for
early access to ONT Minion has been denied. We created an online petition so
that Oxford Nanopore reconsiders its decision. [Please sign it here](https://d
ocs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dDhGRUJsUDVyaXRVNmRJMHJGczRSRWc6MA
) and forward the link to others. Text of the petition is shown below.

> Genome scientist Lex Nederbragt has been very active in the online community
about sharing information on next-generation sequencing technologies. Also,
his blog is generally considered fair, impartial and objective regarding
various technologies. We are saddened to learn that his request for early
access to Minion has been rejected. Since Nanopore sequencing is considered an
important technology by many researchers (incl. us), we believe our knowledge
and decision about the technology will be greatly enhanced by evaluation done
by Dr. Nederbragt.

\-------------------------------------------------------

An open and impartial review of the technology will be beneficial for both the
research community and the company itself. Tweets like following are bad PR,
in our humble opinion.
