This morning, we have been scouring the web to find information on the best
ways to download all abstracts in bulk from Pubmed. This commentary is on what
we found so far, because others may be interested in doing the same task.

The simplest method is to go to [the ftp site at
NCBI](ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/) and download everything. Please
note that the abstracts are open access, but full articles may not always be
so. You will need to sign a [copyright form with
NCBI](http://www.nlm.nih.gov/databases/download.html) to do any text-mining
not covered by US copyright laws.
[Here](http://friendfeed.com/larsjuhljensen/5f628df0/downloading-just-over-
half-of-pubmed-central?embed=1) you can read an interesting discussion on what
is and is not allowed under copyright laws.

Those who like to do more sophisticated analysis can either use NCBI
[E-utilities tool](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25500/) or a cool
software called [textpresso](http://www.textpresso.org/). We also came across
another tool called
[refnavigator](http://www.refnavigator.com/entrezpubmed.html), but do not know
how good it is.

We found a [biostars discussion
thread](http://www.biostars.org/post/show/10026/how-do-people-go-about-pubmed-
text-mining/) to be very helpful to learn about various experts trying to
solve the same problem as ours.

Finally, [here](http://rpsychologist.com/how-to-download-complete-xml-records-
from-pubmed-and-extract-data/) is a cool way to do the above task using R.
