> Little is known about the genetic basis of convergent traits that originate
repeatedly over broad taxonomic scales. The myogenic electric organ has
evolved six times in fishes to produce electric fields used in communication,
navigation, predation, or defense. We have examined the genomic basis of the
convergent anatomical and physiological origins of these organs by assembling
the genome of the electric eel (Electrophorus electricus) and sequencing
electric organ and skeletal muscle transcriptomes from three lineages that
have independently evolved electric organs. Our results indicate that, despite
millions of years of evolution and large differences in the morphology of
electric organ cells, independent lineages have leveraged similar
transcription factors and developmental and cellular pathways in the evolution
of electric organs.

Later I will write more about the biology and bioinformatics aspects, but for
the time being, many thanks to many blog readers, who helped me with codes and
suggestions on bioinformatics. I tried to acknowledge all relevant ones I
could think of (Ruibang Luo, Rayan Chikhi, Jared Simpson), but many thanks to
others I may have inadvertently missed.
