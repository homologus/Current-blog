> Genome sequences are now available for hundreds of species sampled across
the animal phylogeny, bringing key features of animal genome evolution into
sharper focus. The field of animal evolutionary genomics has focused on
identifying and classifying the diversity genomic features, reconstructing the
history of evolutionary changes in animal genomes, and testing hypotheses
about the evolutionary relationships of animals. The grand challenges moving
forward are to connect evolutionary changes in genomes with particular
evolutionary changes in phenotypes, and to determine which changes are driven
by selection. This will require far greater genome sampling both across and
within species, extensive phenotype data, a well resolved animal phylogeny,
and advances in comparative methods.
