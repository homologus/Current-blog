Sorry for our unannounced absence over the last few days. We have been working
on a marine genome project in its final stage, and we got busy working on gene
annotations, analysis and preparing the manuscript. In the meanwhile, plenty
of bioinformatics and non-bioinformatics materials collected on our desk, and
we will start posting in an hour or two.

Stay tuned !!
