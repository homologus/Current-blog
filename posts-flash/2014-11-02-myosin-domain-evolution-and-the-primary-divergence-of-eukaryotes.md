is important in the context eukaryotic evolution in general and the evolution
of cilia/actin cytoskeleton in particular.

> Eukaryotic cells have two contrasting cytoskeletal and ciliary
organizations. The simplest involves a single cilium-bearing centriole,
nucleating a cone of individual microtubules (probably ancestral for unikonts:
animals, fungi, Choanozoa and Amoebozoa). In contrast, bikonts (plants,
chromists and all other protozoa) were ancestrally biciliate with a younger
anterior cilium, converted every cell cycle into a dissimilar posterior cilium
and multiple ciliary roots of microtubule bands. Here we show by comparative
genomic analysis that this fundamental cellular dichotomy also involves
different myosin molecular motors. We found 37 different protein domain
combinations, often lineage-specific, and many previously unidentified. The
sequence phylogeny and taxonomic distribution of myosin domain combinations
identified five innovations that strongly support unikont monophyly and the
primary bikont/unikont bifurcation. We conclude that the eukaryotic
cenancestor (last common ancestor) had a cilium, mitochondria, pseudopodia,
and myosins with three contrasting domain combinations and putative functions.
