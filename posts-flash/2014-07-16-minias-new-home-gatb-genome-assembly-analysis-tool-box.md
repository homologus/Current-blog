The readers of our blog should be very familiar with parts of this project
through their introduction with Minia assembler and DSK k-mer counter. Minia
uses the same idea as diginorm (Bloom filters), but builds an entire assembler
with it. Now Rayan Chikhi, Guillaume Rizk, Dominique Lavenier and their
collaborators have converted those programs into an entire library with useful
modules.

> Motivation: Efficient and fast NGS algorithms are essential to analyze the
terabytes of data generated by the next generation sequencing machines. A
serious bottleneck can be the design of such algorithms, as they require
sophisticated data structures and advanced hardware implementation.

Results: We propose an open-source library dedicated to genome assembly and
analysis to fasten the process of developing efficient software. The library
is based on a recent optimized de-Bruijn graph implementation allowing complex
genomes to be processed on desktop computers using fast algorithms with very
low memory footprints.

Availability and Implementation: The GATB library is written in C++ and is
available at the following web site http://gatb.inria.fr under the A-GPL
license.
