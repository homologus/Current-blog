Heng Li, whose [BWA-MEM paper at arxiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.3997) may
some day become the most cited bioinformatics paper [getting rejected by a
peer-reviewed journal](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/students/2013/05/29
/mapping-god-scientifically-dishonest/), wrote a number of informative
comments that our readers may find interesting. We are compiling the links
here so that you do not miss them.

i) In the commentary "Mapping God Found Scientifically Dishonest by Anonymous
Peer Reviewers", [a reader
asked](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/students/2013/05/29/mapping-god-
scientifically-dishonest/#comment-313) \-

> Would be interesting to know what exactly the concerns of the reviewer were.
There are a lot accusations and pretenses, but a lack of facts.

and [Heng provided a detailed
reply](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/students/2013/05/29/mapping-god-
scientifically-dishonest/#comment-315).

ii) On the more technical side, in ["Bi-directional BWT and 2BWT Alignment
Algorithm"](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/blog/2013/06/01/bi-directional-bwt-
or-2-way-bwt-2bwt/), Heng [explained bi-directional bwt
algorithm](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/blog/2013/06/01/bi-directional-bwt-or-2
-way-bwt-2bwt/comment-page-1/#comment-124320) to answer [reader Paul's
question](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/blog/2013/06/01/bi-directional-bwt-or-2
-way-bwt-2bwt/comment-page-1/#comment-124318).

iii) In a Biostar-related thread, [we published Heng's detailed views on
Biostar](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/software/2013/06/13/biostars-ii-views-of-
heavy-users-infrequent-users-and-exes/).

\----------------------------------------------------------

We also have couple of questions for Heng, if he has time.

i) [BLASR paper on aligning Pacbio
reads](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/13/238) benchmarked the
algorithm by comparing with few other aligners, and found BWA-SW to the only
one worthy of consideration. Given that BWA-MEM is an improvement over BWA-SW,
we wonder how well BWA-MEM would perform on Pacbio reads. Unlike Illumina
reads, Pacbio reads are indel-heavy due to technological limitations.

ii) [You wrote](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/students/2013/05/29/mapping-god-
scientifically-dishonest/#comment-315) \-

> I guess no more than five people in the world understand how bwa-mem finds
seeds.

Who are those five people? :)
