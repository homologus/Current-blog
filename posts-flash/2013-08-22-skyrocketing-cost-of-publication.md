Between 1986 and 2006 journal prices have increased by 321%, while inflation
has increased 68%.

The trend does not make sense at all, because with electronic technology and
ease of communication, the cost of publishing should go down, not up.

However, does the above figure make sense, when we present two companion
charts from ["What's Up with
Inflation?"](http://www.oftwominds.com/blogjuly13/inflation7-13.html)

The same factors - electronic technology and ease of communication - should
lower the prices of education and medical care, no?

We know what is pushing the cost of education. It is the federally backed
student loan. Matt Taibbi wrote a very nice article on that topic that just
came out - ["Ripping Off Young America: The College-Loan
Scandal"](http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/ripping-off-young-america-
the-college-loan-scandal-20130815). We also know the source of high rate of
inflation in medical care. Just remove 'cal' from the last two words, and you
identify the 1,000 pound gorilla there. Then is it possible that journal
prices are going up at high rate, because government funds pay for publication
cost? If we say that the journals are 'price-gouging', why exclude the
University cartel and the medical cartel?

....something to think about.
