from Alyssa C Frazee, Geo Pertea, Andrew E Jaffe, Ben Langmead, Steven L
Salzberg, Jeffrey T Leek appears interesting. We have not gone through the
details yet and would like to know what our readers found.

> We have built a statistical package called Ballgown for estimating
differential expression of genes, transcripts, or exons from RNA sequencing
experiments. Ballgown is designed to work with the popular Cufflinks
transcript assembly software and uses well-motivated statistical methods to
provide estimates of changes in expression. It permits statistical analysis at
the transcript level for a wide variety of experimental designs, allows
adjustment for confounders, and handles studies with continuous covariates.
Ballgown provides improved statistical significance estimates as compared to
the Cuffdiff differential expression tool included with Cufflinks. We
demonstrate the flexibility of the Ballgown package by re-analyzing 667
samples from the GEUVADIS study to identify transcript-level eQTLs and
identify non-linear artifacts in transcript data. Our package is freely
available from: <https://github.com/alyssafrazee/ballgown>
