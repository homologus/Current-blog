title: Openness and Online Reputation Recognized in Grant Reviews!

When we talk to our collaborators in academia, many are very skeptical about
this strange media called 'blog', especially when it comes to mentioning in a
grant review. A recent blog post from Titus Brown shows that the tide is
changing.

[Openness and online reputation recognized in grant
reviews!](http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/openness-and-online-reputation-
recognized-in-grant-reviews.html)

For each of the last two summers, I've returned from co-teaching our
[Analyzing Next-Generation Sequencing Data
course](http://bioinformatics.msu.edu/ngs-summer-course-2013), slept for 48
hours straight, and then hunkered down and bunkered up to write grants. (To be
clear, sometimes this bunkering up involves travelling out to California and
sitting on my in-laws' beach, so the environment is always very bunkerish.)
Last year this resulted in [a bunch of grant
proposals](http://ged.msu.edu/interests.html), including a resub NSF CAREER, a
resub NIH R25 for the summer course, a Cyberinfrastructure Education
supplement (funded!), an ill-fated Moore Foundation proposal, an NSF IGERT-
CIF21 training grant proposal, and an NSF/NIH BIGDATA proposal.

Digression: just in case you are thinking of trying to write upwards of 8
grants in a 6 month period? Don't. It's not fun, even if you're on a beach
some of the time.

[The BIGDATA proposal](http://ged.msu.edu/downloads/2012-bigdata-nsf.pdf)
(oddly termed a "Small BIGDATA proposal"...) was really a shot in the dark; it
proposed to build on our digital normalization algorithm to implement a
variety of low-memory streaming prefilters for sequencing data. I included a
lot of preliminary data and tried to build my usual connections between good
computer science, good computing, good software engineering, and good open
science. I had no idea if this aspect of the grant would be well received.

Most of these interests have not been encouraged, outside of the blogosphere
and tweetstream. Administrators at MSU have ranged from offering amused and
only slightly condescending comments ("well, it probably won't hurt much, but
is it really that important!?") to outright discouragement or disbelief
("waste of time and energy"). Many of my fellow faculty have realized that I'm
passionate and loud about it and have at least stopped arguing that it's a
waste of my time.

Well, I just got reviews back for the BIGDATA grant, and -- while I still
don't know if it's going to be funded -- all of the reviews specifically and
positively mentioned my "side" activities in open source, scientific software
engineering and testing, and open science/open data; see the excerpts below.
I'm particularly happy with the reviewer referenced our diginorm paper on
arXiv, because it lends weight to the argument for preprints.

Reviewer 1:

>

"The PI is acknowledged as a leader in the field in promoting open-source code
and rigorous software development processes."

"PI Brown takes a very open-source community-driven approach to software
development and has a first rate reputation."

"Because the authors are clearly committed to the widest possible distribution
of their software, their approach is likely to have substantial impact."

"This application points to a long and successful track-record and experience
in following rigorous but open software development processes."

"As noted above, the PI clearly understands how to rigorously test software
with automated test harnesses and a proper source-controlled software
development environment. In addition, because the PI emphasizes community
input into the work, the developed libraries will likely be tested and refined
by many users."

"The use of IPython notebooks to share execution environments is particularly
intriguing. Software will be shared under an open-source model, which is
entirely appropriate for this type of software library work that will serve as
a community resource. The github "pull" request model will support automatic
patching and further strengthens the software sharing plan."

Reviewer 2:

>

"Laboratory employs effective software development methods. P.I. is interested
in and has a track record of developing usable software."

"The proposers are appropriately careful about use of source control and
handling of software and source code. The software sharing plan is
appropriate."

Reviewer 3:

>

"I was aware of the basic methods of this proposal, having previously read the
PI's arXiv manuscript."

"The PI is a strong advocate and leader for improved data sharing and
computational reproducibility. Software sharing plan is excellent. The PI
demonstrates a commitment to open software."

\---

And, finally, one entertaining comment --

>

"As the PI points out, lack of infinite computational resources has actually
been a motivator of the proposed path to make genome analysis more efficient
in memory and time. The environment at MSU, however, seems more than adequate
for the proposed work."

(I'm not sure who does have infinite computational resources ;)

\---

Coming in the face of a long history of indirect experience of scorn for these
workmanlike details in grants (for a good time, go ask Fernando Perez about
his NSF review panel experiences! stand a few feet away, though...), I'd love
to argue that these comments indicate a sea change in review panels, and that
computational biologists should now be on notice that good and open software
development is a critical component of grants. That's probably not the case:
the BIGDATA call was very specifically about real software. But certainly it's
a good sign, and -- assuming we get funded -- it will strengthen my arguments
that this kind of stuff really matters for important things like getting
money.

Oh, and a plug -- we teach the kind of stuff mentioned in the comments above
in [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org), and we'll come give a
workshop at your institution for the cost of travel. [Check it out](http
