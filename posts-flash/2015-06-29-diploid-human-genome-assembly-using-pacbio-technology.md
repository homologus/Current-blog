We are surprised that the researchers are using technology from a company that
was supposed to go out of business due to competition from Oxford Nanopore. A
new Nature Method paper reports -

[Assembly and diploid architecture of an individual human genome via single-
molecule technologies](http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/
nmeth.3454.html)

> We present the first comprehensive analysis of a diploid human genome that
combines single-molecule sequencing with single-molecule genome maps. Our
hybrid assembly markedly improves upon the contiguity observed from
traditional shotgun sequencing approaches, with scaffold N50 values
approaching 30 Mb, and we identified complex structural variants (SVs) missed
by other high-throughput approaches. Furthermore, by combining Illumina short-
read data with long reads, we phased both single-nucleotide variants and SVs,
generating haplotypes with over 99% consistency with previous trio-based
studies. Our work shows that it is now possible to integrate single-molecule
and high-throughput sequence data to generate de novo assembled genomes that
approach reference quality.

Human Genome) in Pacbio blog.
