On January 1st, Omicsomics blog requested for the perfect scaffolder.

> Rather than make any New Year's resolutions of my own, which I would then
feel guilty about not keeping, I've decided to make one for someone else: they
will write the perfect open source scaffolder. There's a lot of scaffolders
out there, both stand-alone and integrated into various assemblers, but none
are quite right.

On March 6th, a benchmarking paper from Sanger Institute delivers it,
provided...

[A comprehensive evaluation of assembly scaffolding
tools](http://genomebiology.com/content/pdf/gb-2014-15-3-r42.pdf)

> We further dissect the performance of the scaffolders using real and
simulated sequencing data derived from the genomes of Staphylococcus aureus,
Rhodobacter sphaeroides, Plasmodium falciparum and Homo sapiens. The results
from simulated data are of high quality, with **several of the tools producing
perfect output.

....

Overall, SGA, SOPRA and SSPACE generally outperform the other tools on our

datasets.**

The paper seems to have done a very thorough job by checking each scaffolder
based on multiple aligners. The choice of aligner matters !!

P. S.

1\. Please note that the subject line is written in jest. Real scaffolders on
real data perform quite lousily given that '90% correct' scaffolding is still
a bad situation for those 10% of erroneous parts of the genome.

2\. Wish the paper could compare SPAdes along with other scaffolding methods.
