Michael Schatz mentioned that ENCODE leader Mike Snyder will be presenting at
the #GI2013 meeting, but his name is nowhere in [the list of
presenters](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/blog/2013/10/30/genome-informatics-
meeting-cshl/).

Have no worry !! Through our NSA and other spying channels, we received a
video describing his research.

For those looking for less serious content than the above video, the following
map shows the locations all next-gen sequencing machines around the world

For some strange reason, none is listed in Russia. Did they all go offline
since Snowden's arrival?
