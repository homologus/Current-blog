We covered Rayan Chikhi's

[Informed and Automated k-Mer Size Selection for Genome
Assembly](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/blog/2013/04/23/informed-and-automated-k
-mer-size-selection-for-genome-assembly/)

few months back. He presented on the same topic on the HitSeq and received the
best paper award. Congratulations Rayan !!

Those working on genome assembly should also take a look at Jared Simpson's
preqc pre-processing module. We covered it here -

[Very Helpful Preprocessing Module for Those Interested in Assembling
Genomes](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/blog/2013/07/02/cool-preprocessing-model-
