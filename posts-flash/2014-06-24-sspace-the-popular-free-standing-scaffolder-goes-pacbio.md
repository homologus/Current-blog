[SSPACE-LongRead: scaffolding bacterial draft genomes using long read sequence

Background

The recent introduction of the Pacific Biosciences RS single molecule
sequencing technology has opened new doors to scaffolding genome assemblies in
a cost-effective manner. The long read sequence information is promised to
enhance the quality of incomplete and inaccurate draft assemblies constructed
from Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) data.

Results

Here we propose a novel hybrid assembly methodology that aims to scaffold pre-
assembled contigs in an iterative manner using PacBio RS long read information
as a backbone. On a test set comprising six bacterial draft genomes, assembled
using either a single Illumina MiSeq or Roche 454 library, we show that even a
50x coverage of uncorrected PacBio RS long reads is sufficient to drastically
reduce the number of contigs. Comparisons to the AHA scaffolder indicate our
strategy is better capable of producing (nearly) complete bacterial genomes.

Conclusions

The current work describes our SSPACE-LongRead software which is designed to
upgrade incomplete draft genomes using single molecule sequences. We conclude
that the recent advances of the PacBio sequencing technology and chemistry, in
combination with the limited computational resources required to run our
program, allow to scaffold genomes in a fast and reliable manner.
