Scott Edmunds (@scedmunds) is an editor of GigaSciece, the new, supposedly
cutting-edge journal sponsored by BGI. This is a cross-post from [his blog at
GigaScience](http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/gigablog/2014/02/28/having-a
-finger-on-the-pulse-of-data-citation/). I think GigaScience is doing a lot of
innovative thinking in building a scientific journal that fits the internet-
centric world of 21st century.
