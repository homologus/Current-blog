We added two new sets of charts in our [charts
gallery](http://homolog.us/CI/index.php/charts).

The first one shows the global distribution of reported transcriptomic
datasets in NCBI GEO database. The number of measurements submitted by US-
based researchers far exceed any other country. I do not know, whether some
European researchers submit their data only to Arrayexpress (European database
like GEO) creating some bias in the following chart.

The above chart is based on data up to April 2010. We expect to regularly
update it with the latest data [at this
link](http://homolog.us/CI/index.php/charts/country).

We also investigated the yearly trends for the most active countries. You can
see those trends at [this
link](http://homolog.us/CI/index.php/charts/countries). You will find that
much of the difference in numbers between USA and other countries were from
the earlier years (2000-2007). Countries like Canada and China are seeing
spectacular growth in transcriptomic research over the last 2-3 years.
