A [new
paper](http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/28/18/i311.full) on
assembly of highly repetitive regions came out in the Bioinformatics journal.
It actually came from conference proceeding of [ECCB 2012 being held in
Basel](http://www.eccb12.org/home).

**Key features:**

i) It is a overlap-layout-consensus algorithm and it works by iteratively
extending non-repetitive seeds.

ii) It was tested on yeast teleomer data. Hence the name Telescoper.

iii) The source code can be downloaded from
http://sourceforge.net/p/telescoper.

iv) To say anything more, we need to run the program on real data.
