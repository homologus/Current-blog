**Publishing**
<!--more-->

Getting your research report locked up so that the public cannot see.

**Publishing in high visibility journal**

Getting your research report removed from public view for ever.

Recently we tried to access [a 1951 paper at
Nature](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v167/n4240/abs/167201a0.html)
and, to our utter surprise, found the journal keeping it locked up 62 years
after 'publication' !!! Copyright laws, initially created to protect
individual authors, now allow these publishing houses to do whatever they
want.

**Science Paper**

Fictional text, which the authors pay to get published ('publish' defined as
above).

**Scientist**

A derogatory term for PI (principal investigator). For example, you can insult
someone by saying "he is only a scientist, not a PI". Fifteen years ago, the
opposite statement could have been an insult.

**Higher Organism**

An organism with higher level of government funding.

**Lower Vertebrate**

A vertebrate NIH and other funding agencies does not care about.

**Bioinformatician**

A technician or scientist (used in derogatory way), who can run computer
programs to analyze 'big science' data.

**Bioinformatics Guru**

A technician or scientist (used in derogatory way), who can run the above
programs from command line.

**Bioinformatics PI**

So rare that he is given a unique name - Titus Brown. Only person with more
extraordinary abilities than him is [Kanye
West](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVBQpp8U5lw).

**Personal Genomics**

Eugenics for the ipad generation.

**New Study Reveals**

New study failed utterly except in its ability to fool a journalist. For a
detailed list of revealing studies, check

Insight"](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/blog/2013/06/05/shocking-finding-that-
genomes-by-themselves-provide-little-insight/)

**College Student**

A kid so weak in math that he cannot comprehend the compounding formula in his
student loan contract.

**Graduate Student**

When the above kid finally reads his student loan contract.

Did we miss something?
