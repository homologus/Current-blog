Shengfeng Huang, the author of HaploMerger, informed us about the release of
HaploMerger2 built with new and improved algorithm. Those working on assembly
of heterozygous genomes should give it a try.

Here is the new flowchart of HaploMerger2 -

> Now it comes with a new pipeline which can:

0\. be more efficient, accurate and easier to use;

1\. reconstruct the allelic relationships within a diploid assembly;

2\. detect and correct mis-joins in a diploid assembly;

3\. reconstruct two haploid assemblies for the diploid assembly: the reference
and the alternative haploid assemblies;

4\. further scaffold a haploid assembly (by using third-party software) to
restore and achieve better continuity;

5\. detect and remove tandem mis-assemblies from haploid (or so diploid)
assemblies;

6\. finish N-gaps in haploid assemblies (by using third-party software) to
achieve better contiguity;

7\. Many new features, improved quality and bug fixing.
