In [Senate panel approves $2 billion raise for NIH in
2016](http://news.sciencemag.org/funding/2015/06/senate-panel-approves-2
-billion-raise-nih-2016), Uncle Al wrote -

> I worked at NIH, as did my roommate. NIH it is a budgetary spit bucket. NIH
research is process fluid for managerial banquets, metaphoric and literal. He
milked rats of urine, with his supervisor behind him, watching. I was a
Technical Information Specialist pissing into managerial wind. Grant funding
decisions were not based upon empirical fact.

He added -

home exhausted. Report it? I was in on it. If they had pushed a little quiet
folding green and said "jump," I would have asked "how high?" They didn't, so
I memo'd the truth.

NIH is repaired from the top down not the bottom up. Defund NIH 50% and watch
Kilkenny cats evolve in a suddenly resource-sparse environment.

I have personally seen the inside of another government agency, and it is the
same story. The government agencies typically maintain a 'charity arm' and a
'waste arm'. The charity arm pays maybe 5-10% of the agency's budget on
supporting college/university professors (but not the big-shots), while the
remaining 90-95% goes to waste arm. From time to time, the agencies started
their drive to increase budget, and the method was to squeeze the charity arm
even further. That would make the college professors scream so much that that
the Congress would be forced to raise budget. I have seen the entire circus so
many times that I used to wonder, whether there was a book on it.
