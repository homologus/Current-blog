We wrote about Sailfish, Kallisto and Salmon extensively in the past. Readers
will be happy to read [Rob Patro et al.'s latest biorxiv paper discussing the
arrival of Salmon](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/10/03/021592)\-

> Existing methods for quantifying transcript abundance require a fundamental
compromise: either use high quality read alignments and experiment-specific
models or sacrifice them for speed. We introduce Salmon, a quantification
method that overcomes this restriction by combining a novel "lightweight"
alignment procedure with a streaming parallel inference algorithm and a
feature-rich model. These innovations yield both exceptional accuracy and
order-of-magnitude speed benefits over traditional alignment-based methods.
