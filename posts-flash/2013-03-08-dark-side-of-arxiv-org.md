Many bioinformatics groups recently discovered arxiv.org and are going gaga
about submitting all their lab preprints there before sending them to
journals. There are even blogs like [Haldane's
Sieve](http://haldanessieve.org/) tailored toward reviewing 'bleeding edge'
arxiv preprints as soon as they show up.

Physicists were using arxiv.org for over two decades and found out about their
alleged practice of blacklisting authors that appear very frightening to us.
Professor Brian Josephson [commented in our earlier blog
post](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/2012/08/06/nature-journal-recognizes-arxiv-
org-reaches-its-own-wile-e-coyote-moment/) \-

What you dont say is that arxiv has a practice of quick reviewing of
submissions before they become public, blocking submissions that look unusual.
There is no effective appeal against this process as there usually is with
journal publication, and since major advances as opposed to incremental ones
often do look unusual and are much contested at the time, this policy is thus
one that acts against the interests of scientific advance. People may be
interested in the web site [archivefreedom.org](http://archivefreedom.org/),
set up to publicise the misdeeds of the archive, and in an abortive attempt
(see http://www.tcm.phy.cam.ac.uk/~bdj10/articles/arxiv_correspondence.html)
to get arxivs procedures improved.

We checked [archivefreedom.org](http://archivefreedom.org/) and found [rather
scary case histories](http://archivefreedom.org/casehistories.htm) of
individual scientists being blocked from sending papers to arxiv.org,
allegedly because of political reasons. The most worrisome case is of [Carlos
Castro Perelman, where apparently

arXiv.org administrators threatened his institution for supporting him. Dr.

**My Struggle with Ginsparg (arXiv.org) and the Road to Cyberia: 

A Scientific-Gulag in Cyberspace**

> The Troubles began with the Nuclear Physics B Journal

Lantz Miller (New York resident, Columbia University Journalist student) in
his article in Crosscurrents magazine: "Migrations of Ideas in the Age of the
Internet and the Socio/Cultural Hegemony of the Scientific Community: Case
Studies" that was based on his talk at a Rutgers University Conference in
March 2002 (New Jersey) sponsored by the Sociology Dept, described very
accurately the origins of my problems with Ginsparg. In the late Fall of 1999
I received two positive referee reports of a mainstream paper submitted to
Nuclear Physics B (NPB). The editorial office (Elsevier publishers in Holland)
then asked me for a disk file (Tex file) of such paper, another intended sign
of publication. A few months later in January 28, 2000, I received a highly
suspicious declination letter (e-mail ) from NPB (Paul Schuddenboom) after a
member of the Editorial board had shown a particular interest in my paper but
later vetoed its publication (I think it may have been H. Ooguri, now at
Caltech, but I have no way of proving this due to the secrecy of the journal).

I would have not have minded at all if they had asked me to revise the paper
to fit the needs of the member of the Editorial board. After receiving this
highly suspicious declination letter, the co-director of my center in Atlanta,
CTSPS (Center for Theoretical Studies of Physical Systems in Clark Atlanta
University) Prof. Carlos Handy wrote a letter to NPB expressing our concerns
for this declination letter, especially after having received two positive
referee reports and having sent them the disk file of my paper.

What we received back in response from NPB was yet another slap in the face.
Not only they insisted that they had done nothing wrong, because they had not
"promised" anything, but they had looked at my recent work in the e-archives,
run at the time by the Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico, and found my work
to be outlandish. NPB was clearly referring to my work on the Extended ("
new") Relativity Theory (later developed in Clifford Spaces) based on earlier
work by Laurent Nottale (in 1983) on the Scale Relativity Theory. In the
latter theory the Planck length scale was postulated as a minimum scale
(resolution) in Nature, not unlike postulating the speed of light as the
maximum attainable speed in the ordinary Relativity Theory.

However, what NPB seemed to have forgotten entirely is that my NPB paper that
had received two positive referee reviews was a mainstream paper that had
nothing to do whatsoever with my work on the Extended ("new") Relativity
theory. In fact, an extended version of my original NPB paper has been
published in the first rate journal Classical and Quantum Gravity 20 (2003)
3577-3592: "Anti de Sitter Spaces (AdS2n) from SO(2n -1, 2) Instantons ".

The reader may ask, what does all this have to do with Ginsparg? Well, lo and
behold, when I tried submitting my most recent paper (at the time) in early
February 2000 to the hep-th (high energy physics theory) category my paper was
removed and displaced to the general physics category (the bottom of the pile
in readership and audience). It does not take Sherlock Holmes to figure out
that it was NPB who complained to Ginsparg that Castro was posting outlandish
papers in the Los Alamos archives. After all NPB admitted in writing that they
had looked at my work in the Los Alamos archives in late January 2000 and
found my work "outlandish." The reader may say that this is nothing but
circumstantial evidence and that it does not constitute a proof. People have
been arrested, tried, convicted and executed in the USA based solely on
circumstantial evidence.

Having explained the sequence of events that led to the beginning of my
problems with Ginsparg in early February 2000, I must add that I wrote a
letter to NPB denouncing what I thought to be their shameful behavior. They
politely wrote back and told me that they will inquire about this unfortunate
incident. I never heard a word from them again (to be expected).

The next time I tried posting a paper to the hep-th archive-category the same
thing occurred, it was removed automatically and diverted to the general
physics category without the possibility of cross-listing to other categories.
I realized that the robot at the archives was programmed to recognize my
e-mail address and to divert my papers automatically from the hep-th category
to the general physics category.

What to do next? Well, I decided to post my next paper from the e-mail account
of one of my co-authors of a joint-paper, Jorge Mahecha, directly from
Trieste, Italy, since I was visiting Trieste at the time. It worked, the paper
was successfully posted in the hep-th archive-category in August, 2000,
without any problems until, until ......

Until I was traveling in France and Spain in August, September, when Jorge
Mahecha e-mailed me telling me that Ginsparg had written an ultimatum giving
us a two-day period to remove the fraudulent Cambridge affiliation from one of
our other co-authors, M.S. El Naschie, chief Editor of the Journal of Chaos,
Solitons and Fractals. Apparently Ginsparg received a complaint from Cambridge
University (later I found out that it was Michael Green). Since Jorge Mahecha
had only two days, he had no choice but to comply and removed the El Naschie's
Cambridge affiliation without being able to make a thorough inquiry as to the
veracity of the horrible allegations against M.S El Naschie. Shortly after,
Jorge Mahecha opted to remove the paper altogether to avoid any further
problems, before we had an opportunity to perform an investigation of the
veracity of the serious charges raised by Michael Green (at Cambridge
University) against M. S. El Naschie.

Having described the chain events in late January 2000 (the NPB fiasco), the
subsequent removal of my papers to the hep-th category in early February 2000,
and afterwards, the El Naschie-Michael Green incident in late August 2000,
which I will analyze in further detail shortly, I will now reveal a personal
e-mail written by Ginsparg himself to Fred Cooper at Los Alamos which is full
of insults, lies and threats.

The Actual e-mail from Ginsparg to Fred Cooper at Los Alamos:

>

Date: Fri, 29 Sep 2000 13:47:02 -0600 (MDT)

From: Paul Ginsparg ginsparg@lanl.gov

To: fcooper@physics.bc.edu

CC: simeon@mmm.lanl.gov, schwander@horse.lanl.gov

Subject: Re: Castro Clarification

a) castro is an obvious nut and all of his papers are abject nonsense

b) castro had a paper with a co-author whose affiliation was forged as DAMTP
(Cambridge), and we received a complaint directly from DAMTP. he was given a
deadline to correct or remove the affiliation, or lose submission privileges.
he CHOSE not to comply.

conclusion: castro is more than welcome to publish in conventional journals we
don't have time for him here, and he is fortunate that he is permitted in the
General Physics category.

[ next is a phrase from F. Cooper's initial letter to Ginsparg ]

"Carlos Handy at Clark Atlanta was a former post-doc of mine and this person's
boss. If you could handle this with some sensitivity, I would appreciate that"

[ Ginsparg continues ]

note that if clark university will insist on this, then we will cease to
regard clark university as a responsible accredited institution. (we rely on
institutional affiliation for effective endorsement. note most of his recent
activity has been from italy so we have no idea why clark univ is even
involved at this point.)

you should explain to your former postdoc Carlos Handy that he is the one who
should be embarrassed at this point. we wouldn't care except this one idiot
has wasted more time than the average ten idiots... i hope this is sensitive
enough

There is [lot more at the original

to go through it before submitting another preprint to arxiv.

Archivefreedom.org also alleges that the 'new' endorsement system is merely a
smokescreen.

> The New Endorsement System: Merely a Smoke Screen

In January 2004, arXiv.org introduced an automated endorsement system which
was touted by operators of the system as an answer to complaints about the
archive's restrictive policies. However, there have been cases where
blacklisted scientists have attempted to use this supposedly objective
endorsement system and the outcome has been overriden to ensure that their
works are still blocked.

Another drawback is that most endorsers are fearful of endorsing novel papers
because they worry that they could lose their endorser status if their
decision runs counter to the tastes of the arXiv moderators. In fact, the
arXiv.org website states that the archive administrators reserve the right to
revoke any endorser's endorsement status. When one blacklisted scientist's
paper was rejected, the reason given by the archive moderator was: "No
legitimate endorsements from current users." When the scientist then asked
"will you guarantee that persons who endorse me will not be victimised by
having their arXiv privileges withdrawn?" no substantive response was
forthcoming.

The scientist concluded from this that they had refused to guarantee that
anyone who endorsed him would not be punished for doing so. Thus one could
surmise that the endorsement system is merely a facade to give the false
impression that the electronic preprint archive operates in a fair manner.

We completely agree with professor Josephson that 'major advances as opposed
to incremental ones often do look unusual and are much contested at the time'.
Are we advancing science here by promoting arxiv.org? Why should such an
importance practice of removing/relisting papers not have any transparency or
procedure of appealing the decision?

\-------------------------------------

Edit.

We requested arxiv.org to comment on the above issues, and Jake Weiskoff from
arxiv.org wrote to us by email:

You may review our moderation policies, located at:

and our primer and submission process via:

for additional information.

Hopefully there will be additional clarifications on the appeal policy, and
lack of transparency on which authors get blacklisted or whether individual
arxiv adminstrators can block a paper for personal or political reasons.
