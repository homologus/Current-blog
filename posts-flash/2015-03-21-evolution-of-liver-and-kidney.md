> I am teaching about this today in my introductory evolution class, and
thought Id include a video showing evidence for evolution that comes from the
development of the human kidney. The video is in French, but Ill explain whats
happening.

The evolutionary/developmental phenomenon of recapitulation, in which
developing organisms are supposed to go through stages that reprise their
evolutionary ancestry, has been in bad repute, but some of that is undeserved.
(Recapitulation is often characterized with the phrase ontogeny recapitulates
phylogeny, with ontogeny meaning development and phylogeny meaning order in
which ancestors evolved.)
