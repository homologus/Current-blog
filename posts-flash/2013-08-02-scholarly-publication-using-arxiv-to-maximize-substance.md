Nassim Nicholas Taleb (@nntaleb) not only comes up with very creative and
original ideas, he is also a master of using social media, drop-box and arxiv
to get his scholarly writings reach his audience unhindered by myriads of
government-funded economics professors. Here is what he wrote [on his facebook
page](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=10151612329413375&id=1

> **HOW TO MAXIMIZE SUBSTANCE.**

Academic production is now up to 99% housekeeping, chickens**t, dealing with
referees and perfecting commas, marketing, and only 1% substance. So trying
the exact opposite with the following mode; wrote a paper, the shortest
possible one on the idea. Put on FB here for 24 hours for crowdsourcing
correction (Carl Fakhry found the math typos and inconsistencies in notation).
Submitted the first draft to ArXiv, where it was posted a with day delay. Kept
some typos in the first version (such as "reponse" instead of "response") to
signal I don't give a f**k, that this is not "job market science".

If the idea has merit, it could eventually circulate perhaps be even
plagiarized, and this may even take years and years. If it lacks in rigor it
will certainly die, as there is no formalism to hide the BS.

All in all the non-substancel part of the process turned out to be < 1 hour.

Now to other, possibly, deeper things.

That helps us feel not too bad about numerous typos in our commentaries here.

The paper mentioned by him can be downloaded from the following link.

[Where Do Thin Tails Come From?](http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.6695)

Nassim Nicholas Taleb

> The literature of heavy tails (typically) starts with a random walk and
finds mechanisms that lead to fat tails under aggregation. We follow the
inverse route and show how starting with fat tails we get to thin-tails when
deriving the probability distribution of the response to a random variable. We
introduce a general dose-response curve and argue that the left and right-
boundedness or saturation of the response in natural things leads to thin-
tails, even when the "underlying" random variable at the source of the
exposure is fat-tailed.

He is writing another paper on 'skin in the game' and it is available from
dropbox.

Abstract

Standard economic theory makes an allowance for the agency problem, but not
the compounding of moral hazard in the presence of informational opacity,
particularly in what concerns tail events. But the ancients did; so did many
aspects of moral philosophy. We propose a global and morally mandatory
heuristic that anyone involved in an action which can possibly generate harm
for others, even probabilistically, should be required to be exposed to some
damage, regardless of context. While perhaps not su?cient, the heuristic is
certainly necessary hence mandatory. It is supposed to counter risk hiding in
the tails. We link the rule to various philosophical approaches to ethics and
moral luck.
