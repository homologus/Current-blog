Readers comfortable with installing and running open-source programs may look
at [this program](http://www.mmass.org/) for analyzing mass spec data. We
never used the program, but got curious after seeing it [mentioned in a
blog](http://naturalproductforum.org/category/bioinformatics/). The program
seems to have plenty have features.
