> Eukaryotes were born of a chimeric union between two prokaryotes, the
progenitors of the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes. Early in eukaryote
evolution,most mitochondrial genes were lost or transferred to the nucleus,
but a core set of genes that code exclusively for products associated with the
electron transport system remained in the mitochondrion. The products of these
mitochondrial genes work in intimate association with the products of nuclear
genes to enable oxidative phosphorylation and core energy production. The need
for coadaptation, the challenge of cotransmission, and the possibility of
genomic conflict between mitochondrial and nuclear genes have profound
consequences for the ecology and evolution of eukaryotic life. An emerging
interdisciplinary field that I call "mitonuclear ecology" is reassessing core
concepts in evolutionary ecology including sexual reproduction, two sexes,
sexual selection, adaptation, and speciation in light of the interactions of
mitochondrial and nuclear genomes.
