Metagenomes assembly is arguably more difficult than genome assembly, because
metagenomes have characteristics of genomes (repeats) as well as
transcriptomes (different subgenomes present at different levels). Titus
Brown's group posted [an interesting paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.2832) at
arxiv.org few weeks back, and we hope you will enjoy it. We started reading it
but got scared within first paragraph, when they mentioned future goal of
assembling a 20 Tb library !!

The large volumes of sequencing data required to sample complex environments
deeply pose new challenges to sequence analysis approaches. De novo
metagenomic assembly effectively reduces the total amount of data to be
analyzed but requires significant computational resources. We apply two pre-
assembly filtering approaches, digital normalization and partitioning, to make
large metagenome assemblies more comput\ ationaly tractable. Using a human gut
mock community dataset, we demonstrate that these methods result in assemblies
nearly identical to assemblies from unprocessed data. We then assemble two
large soil metagenomes from matched Iowa corn and native prairie soils. The
predicted functional content and phylogenetic origin of the assembled contigs
indicate significant taxonomic differences despite similar function. The
assembly strategies presented are generic and can be extended to any
metagenome; full source code is freely available under a BSD license.
