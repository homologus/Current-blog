> Although much is known about human genetic variation, such information is
typically ignored in assembling new genomes. Instead, reads are mapped to a
single reference, which can lead to poor characterization of regions of high
sequence or structural diversity. We introduce a population reference graph,
which combines multiple reference sequences and catalogs of variation. The
genomes of new samples are reconstructed as paths through the graph using an
efficient hidden Markov model, allowing for recombination between different
haplotypes and additional variants. By applying the method to the 4.5-Mb
extended MHC region on human chromosome 6, combining 8 assembled haplotypes,
the sequences of known classical HLA alleles and 87,640 SNP variants from the
1000 Genomes Project, we demonstrate using simulations, SNP genotyping, and
short-read and long-read data how the method improves the accuracy of genome
inference and identified regions where the current set of reference sequences
is substantially incomplete.
