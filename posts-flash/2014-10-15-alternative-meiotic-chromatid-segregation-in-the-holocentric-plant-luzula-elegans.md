> Holocentric chromosomes occur in a number of independent eukaryotic
lineages. They form holokinetic kinetochores along the entire poleward
chromatid surfaces, and owing to this alternative chromosome structure,
species with holocentric chromosomes cannot use the two-step loss of cohesion
during meiosis typical for monocentric chromosomes. Here we show that the
plant Luzula elegans maintains a holocentric chromosome architecture and
behaviour throughout meiosis, and in contrast to monopolar sister centromere
orientation, the unfused holokinetic sister centromeres behave as two distinct
functional units during meiosis I, resulting in sister chromatid separation.
Homologous non-sister chromatids remain terminally linked after metaphase I,
by satellite DNA-enriched chromatin threads, until metaphase II. They then
separate at anaphase II. Thus, an inverted sequence of meiotic sister
chromatid segregation occurs. This alternative meiotic process is most likely
one possible adaptation to handle a holocentric chromosome architecture and
behaviour during meiosis.
