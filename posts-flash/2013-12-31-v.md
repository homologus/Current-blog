4\. **In Scientific Communication, Social Media Took over
Cell/Nature/Science**
<!--more-->

In August 2012, we wrote a commentary titled -

[Nature Journal Recognizes arXiv.org (or its own Wile E. Coyote
Moment)](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/blog/2012/08/06/nature-journal-
recognizes-arxiv-org-reaches-its-own-wile-e-coyote-moment/)

At that time, both concepts promoted in the commentary were ridiculous.
Everyone told us that 'biologists would not post preprints in arxiv.org' and
'dominance of Nature/Science/Cell would never go away'. Fast forward by
sixteen months and you find - (i) NIH and CSHL establish bioarxiv, (ii) a
Nobel laureate utilize the publicity of award-ceremony to talk against
Cell/Nature/Science culture.

Here is the real evidence that the so-called 'high-visibility' journals are
losing their dominance. During early 2013, K. R. Bradnam and collaborators
submitted their Assemblathon 2 paper to arxiv and GigaScience. Assemblathon 2
paper had been a colossal failure by accepted standards of biology, because it
was not published in a 'high-visibility journal'. GigaScience, being an
upstart journal, is fairly low in the pecking order.

On the other hand, based on the measure of actual high-visibility, the
Assemblathon 2 paper was immensely successful. The paper was widely discussed
in the community, and its author used social media (twitter - @assemblathon
and [blog](http://assemblathon.org/post/44431915644/feedback-and-analysis-of-
the-assemblathon-2-p)) to generate and maintain interest in the work.
Moreover, the [open review model of
GigaScience](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/blog/2013/01/07/open-peer-review-
model-for-publishing-scientific-results/) made the process transparent,
constructive and beneficial for the scientists involved. We are definitely
seeing a major change in trend in the overall publication and scientific
communication process.

The last point is best understood by comparing open review model of
GigaScience with the closed review process experienced by Heng Li for his BWA-
MEM paper. An anonymous reviewer called the author 'scientifically dishonest'
for no good reason. As a result, frustrated Heng Li [posted his preprint in
arxiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.3997) and got done with it. More details are
available in the following commentary.

[Mapping God Found Scientifically Dishonest by Anonymous Peer
Reviewers](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/students/2013/05/29/mapping-god-
scientifically-dishonest/)

Overall, 2013 saw an explosion in the use of social media (e.g. blog, github,
twitter, slideshare, biostar, etc.), through which scientists from all over
the globe started to communicate directly with each other (for example, here
is [a cuban blog on bioinformatics and
proteomics](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/blog/2013/10/29/cuban-blog-
bioinformatics-proteomics/)). In earlier years, publishing a paper in a high-
profile journal or presenting in a high-visibility conference were two only
modes of communications, but now publish or perish is being replaced by [Tweet
or Perish](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/blog/2012/10/03/tweet-or-perish/).

The biggest benefit of internet communication is the creation of new services
and ways of sharing, whose equivalents did not exist in the earlier era. Three
examples are shown below.

**Rosalind and Stepic**

Rosalind has been very popular bioinformatics teaching tool and its creators
went on to build another useful service called Stepic. The relevant
commentaries are shown below.

Petersburg](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/blog/2012/09/18/rosalind-project-at-

Team](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/blog/2013/10/02/new-announcement-rosalind-

**Biostar**

In a series of commentaries, we discussed about various aspects of Biostar -
an online question-answer forum for bioinformaticians.

**SOAPdenovo Demystified**

In mid-2012, we received an early access of SOAPdenovo2 executable code and
found it useful.

[Testing SOAPdenovo2 Pre-release
Version](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/blog/2012/06/27/testing-soapdenovo2/)

When the SOAPdenovo2 paper was published six months later, we decided to
understand the 40,000 line C-code, and shared the insights with our readers.
We used blog and wiki for this effort.
