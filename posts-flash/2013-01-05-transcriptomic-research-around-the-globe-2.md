From time to time, [we update our trends
section](http://homolog.us/CI/index.php/charts) with latest data from NCBI GEO
database. Few reports from the last two years are listed here.

[Transcriptomic Research around the
Globe](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/2011/08/18/transcriptomic-research-around-

[In our Trends Section](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/2012/06/17/in-our-trends-

[In our Trends Section II](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/2012/06/17/in-our-

Today, we uploaded new data to [the trends section
again](http://homolog.us/CI/index.php/charts). USA is still the global leader
in transcriptomics research, but, in terms of growth, China and Germany are
doing much better than USA. Data also shows rapid growth of Illumina, but that
is not a surprise in 2013.

Biggest surprise - among transcriptomics research reported from cities around
the globe, [Seattle showed the biggest bump in
2012](http://homolog.us/CI/index.php/charts/cities). Que pasa? What is going
on in our backyard?
