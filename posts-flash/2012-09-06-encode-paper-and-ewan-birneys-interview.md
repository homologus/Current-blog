Here is the part of the interview that caught our attention.

> **How does that discovery help us understand disease?**

Its like opening a door. Think about all the different ways you can study a
particular disease, such as Crohns: Should we look at immune system cells in
the gut? Or should we look at the neurons that fire to the gut? Or should we
be looking at the stomach and how it does something else?

All those are options. Now suddenly ENCODE is letting you examine those
options and say, Well, I really think you should start by looking at this part
of the immune systemthe helper T cells first. And we can do that for a very,
very big set of diseases. Thats really exciting.

When we go through computational biology journals, we find large number of
algorithms related to studying genomes, genes, miRNA, small RNA, etc., but
hardly any algorithm on immune system and T-cell diversity. On the other hand,
the motivation section of proposals funding those projects typically say -
'long term goal of our project is to cure diseases.' It is not as if
computational biologists do not find [interesting things to
do](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/2012/07/31/an-elegant-use-of-sequencing-in-
immunology-finding-t-cell-diversity/) with T-cell data.

We will turn off the rant mode and let you read the whole interview.
