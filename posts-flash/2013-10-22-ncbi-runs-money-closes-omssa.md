More sob-stories are coming out of NCBI. The organization is so short of money
that it has to shut down a [popular tandem mass spectra search engine called
OMSSA](http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omssa/).

We confirmed that the tweet is correct by going to the actual NCBI page and
[seeing the following notice](http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omssa/).

That is puzzling, because we used to think that the biggest cost of a website
is the initial set up. Once it is up and running, the cost of keeping the
servers turned on is rather low, unless the government cannot pay its
electricity bills.
