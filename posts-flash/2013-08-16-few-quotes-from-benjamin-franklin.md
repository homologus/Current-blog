The man was wise beyond limits:

> Life's Tragedy is that we get old to soon and wise too late.

> Who is wise? He that learns from everyone. Who is powerful? He that governs
his passions. Who is rich? He that is content. Who is that? Nobody.

> They who can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety
deserve neither liberty nor safety.

> Remember not only to say the right thing in the right place, but far more
difficult still, to leave unsaid the wrong thing at the tempting moment.

> We are all born ignorant, but one must work hard to remain stupid.

> Tricks and treachery are the practice of fools, that don't have brains
enough to be honest.

> Half a truth is often a great lie.

[One quote from 'genome informatician' Ewan
Birney](http://genomeinformatician.blogspot.com/2012/09/encode-my-own-
thoughts.html), who is a 'Benjamin Franklin' prize winner !!

> We use the bigger number because it brings home the impact of this work to a
much wider audience. But we are in fact using an accurate, well-defined figure
when we say that 80% of the genome has specific biological activity.

**Q. Whatever you love having this high-profile publication.**

A. Of course I like the publications! Publications are the best way for
scientists to communicate with each other, to explain key aspects of the data
and draw some conclusions from them.

\----------------------------------------------------

Franklin responds:

> A learned blockhead is a greater blockhead than an ignorant one.

> It takes many good deeds to build a good reputation, and only one bad one to
lose it.

> How few there are who have courage enough to own their faults, or resolution
enough to mend them.

\----------------------------------------------------

Franklin finishes with two messages. One hopeful one:

> The doors of wisdom are never shut.

and one less so:

> He that won't be counseled can't be helped.
