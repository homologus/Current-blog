> Inheritance-biasing gene drives may be capable of spreading genomic
alterations made in laboratory organisms through wild populations. We
previously considered the potential for RNA-guided gene drives based on the
versatile CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing system to serve as a general method of
altering populations. Here we report molecularly contained gene drive
constructs in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae that are typically copied at
rates above 99% when mated to wild yeast. We successfully targeted both non-
essential and essential genes, showed that the inheritance of an unrelated
cargo gene could be biased by an adjacent drive, and constructed a drive
capable of overwriting and reversing changes made by a previous drive. Our
results demonstrate that RNA-guided gene drives are capable of efficiently
biasing inheritance when mated to wild-type organisms over successive
generations.
