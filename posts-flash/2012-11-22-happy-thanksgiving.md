We start with quotes from three gentlemen, who would be locked up as
terrorists [in contemporary USA](http://www.acting-man.com/?p=20668).

"To learn who rules over you, simply find out who you are not allowed to
criticize.

"Those who would give up Essential Liberty to purchase a little Temporary
Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety."

"The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of
patriots and tyrants."

Who should we be thankful to? To find out, few months back I asked my son
where our food comes from.

"Supermarket" - he replied promptly.

I figured it would be nice to take him to farms. There are quite a few around
here. They allow little children to pick apples and pears from the trees,
which is a fun experience by itself.

"Where does our food come from?" Yesterday I asked him again.

"Fruits and vegetables come from farms. Cookies and candies come from the
supermarket." :)
