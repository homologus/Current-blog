title: How do JGI Data Release Policy and Bleeding Edge Bioinformatics Fit Together?

Apart from technological novelties, our previous commentary on [Quip, Minia,
SlimGene and Titus Brown's paper on Scaling
Metagenome](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/2012/07/19/quip-minia-slimgene-and-
titus-browns-paper-on-scaling-metagenome/) is interesting for another reason.
You can get the sense by reading [a discussion from Titus Brown's
blog](http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/science-f-yeah.html). Professor Brown and
colleages posted their papers at [arxiv.org](http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.4193)
six months before it got accepted in a mainstream journal, and then the
authors of Minia leveraged on the supposedly unpublished paper, and
['unpublished'](http://minia.genouest.org/) an improved approach.

Every time we download a genome from JGI, it makes us go through a long list
of agreements. An example of the standard agreement is posted
[here](http://www.brachypodium.org/?q=node/18). Here is an extract -

> JGI policy is that early release should aid the progress of science. **By
accessing these data, you agree not to publish any articles containing
analyses of genes or genomic data on a whole genome or chromosome scale prior
to publication by JGI and/or its collaborators of a comprehensive genome
analysis (Reserved Analyses).** Reserved analyses include the identification
of complete (whole genome) sets of genomic features such as genes, gene
families, regulatory elements, repeat structures, GC content, or any other
genome feature, and whole-genome- or chromosome- scale comparisons with other
species.

How is 'publish' defined in the fast-moving era of arxiv.org, blogs and
twitter? Am I 'publishing' something by placing a preprint on arxiv.org? Is
writing on a blog about a set of interesting genes based on large-scale
analysis of a JGI sequence banned? Or is the agreement limited to mainstream
journals directly or indirectly funded by bankrupt governments?
