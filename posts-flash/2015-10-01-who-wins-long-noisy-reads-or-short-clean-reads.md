[Short explanation: large number of investors are betting on all kinds of
outcomes based on available news (such as [PacBio
Mini?](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/blog/2015/09/30/pacbio-mini/)), and the
above ratio charts are condensed versions of their expectations over the last
two years. As it appears, those investors are at a crossroad. If the chart
breaks above triangle, long noisy reads have better 'expected' future. (Edit.
added linear scale chart, which is more appropriate for ratios).

Also note that we made our calls exactly two years back -
