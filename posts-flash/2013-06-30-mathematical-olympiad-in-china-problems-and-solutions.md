** [Mathematical olympiad in china problems and solutions](http://www.slideshare.net/SwagataSaha1/mathematical-olympiad-in-china-problems-and-solutions) ** from **[Swagata Saha](http://www.slideshare.net/SwagataSaha1)**

Why do we stress children's mathematics so much? It is because one or two
simple discoveries in mathematics can feed thousands of scientific papers for
many years. For example, please take a look [at this 1994
paper](http://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/Compaq-DEC/SRC-RR-124.pdf) by Mr.
Burrows and Mr. Wheeler, which led to FM index and very powerful nucleotide
search and assembly algorithm.

> The algorithm described here was discovered by one of the authors (Wheeler)
in 1983 while he was working at AT&T; Bell Laboratories, though it has not
previously been published.

The math behind it is so simple that Wheeler did not bother to publish it for
11 years !!
