Dear Readers,
<!--more-->

During the year, we wrote nearly 300 commentaries presenting various
developments in bioinformatics. Now that the year is almost over, we would
like to review them all and identify the five most important contributions. We
understand that we were not able to cover many major contributions in our blog
commentaries. Therefore, please feel free to submit your suggestions so that
we have a complete list of innovations to consider.

**Here are the rules.**

1\. We will consider all types of major contributions and not just papers
published in journals. For example, developments such as
[Rosalind](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/2012/09/18/rosalind-project-at-
algorithmic-biology-laboratory-st-petersburg/) will be included in the
contest. [Haldane's Sieve](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/2012/10/19/thoughts-on-
blogging-and-haldanes-seive/) is also an innovative concept worthy of
consideration.

2\. Speaking of papers, we are ready to look into everything including journal
submission, arxiv submission and conference papers.

3\. We will consider all of your suggestions made on or before Jan 4. Please
feel free to suggest your own work or work of others, and explain why it is
the best discovery in bioinformatics.

4\. After Jan 4, we will make a large list of developments based on our blog
commentaries over the year and your suggestions, and shortlist twenty from
them. Those twenty will be critically examined, and a ranked list of best five
will be posted around Jan 10.

5\. If you think any major discovery was better than those five, please feel
free to submit a comment explaining why.

Any question?

Please feel free to forward this message to others, who would be interested.
