BACKGROUND:

The problem of enumerating bubbles with length constraints in directed graphs
arises in transcriptomics where the question is to identify all alternative
splicing events present in a sample of mRNAs sequenced by RNA-seq.

RESULTS:

We present a new algorithm for enumerating bubbles with length constraints in
weighted directed graphs. This is the first polynomial delay algorithm for
this problem and we show that in practice, it is faster than previous
approaches.

CONCLUSION:

This settles one of the main open questions from Sacomoto et al. (BMC
Bioinform 13:5, 2012). Moreover, the new algorithm allows us to deal with
larger instances and possibly detect longer alternative splicing events.
