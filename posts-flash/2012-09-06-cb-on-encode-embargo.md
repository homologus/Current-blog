We just read an [interesting commentary from Casey
Bergman](http://caseybergman.wordpress.com/2012/09/05/the-cost-to-science-of-
the-encode-publication-embargo/) that links together our last two commentaries

Today everyone is talking about the fantastic discoveries reported by thirty
ENCODE papers, but Casey Bergman discussed about what goes on behind the
screen based on his experience with fly genome paper. Usually high-visibility
journals hold on to many accepted manuscripts for months so that all papers on
the same topic can get published together with the major genome paper. That
way, the genome issue can make an impressive press release. Casey

Casey Bergman correctly argued that this process serves the major journals,
not the scientists, or the people, who pay for the research through government
funding.

> Personally, I cannot see how this embargo system serves anyone in science
other than the major journals. There is no valid scientific reason that major
genome papers and their companions cannot be made available as online accepted
preprints, as is now standard practice in the publishing industry.

Our insider knowledge about multi-month embargo came from another [insect
genome project - honey
bee](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v443/n7114/full/nature05260.html).
The delay was so unbearable for some researchers that it almost caused civil
war among the members of genome project !! Many scientists are on shoe-string
budget to start with, and waiting six months for a paper may mean postponing
grant submission by one year, losing tenure, getting divorce, or [realizing
what basic science is all about](http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/europe/11/1
6/sex.blogger.identity/index.html).

Essentially, basic scientists may think that they are pure souls searching for
laws of nature, but all aspects of their work from grant applications to paper
publication are controlled by various business entities and commercial
interests. When the scientists understand the nature of the system, they
express shock.

Casey Bergman:

> Seeing this process unfold first hand was shocking to me, and has made me
very skeptical of the power that the major journals have to dictate terms
about how we, and other journals, publish our work.

We agree completely, but [we expect them to succumb to even bigger
power](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/2012/08/06/nature-journal-recognizes-arxiv-
org-reaches-its-own-wile-e-coyote-moment/) as argued by several others in CB's
comment section.
