Every year, governments spend millions of dollars for genomic sites and
databases. They come in all kinds of forms - wiki, genome browser, search
engine, biomart and sometimes places to simply [dump large amount of
data](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). From a very top level view, all of
them serve one purpose, namely to provide information about various aspects of
genomic data. With that definition, we need to also throw in the journals and
web-based online forums into the mix. In fact, as you have seen from Scott
Edmund's comment [in the last
thread](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/blog/2013/06/10/rna-seq-data-on-prostate-
cancer-publicly-available-from-bgi/), [GigaScience journal itself is hosting
large amount of bulk data](http://gigadb.org/dataset/100034). Similar task
gets done by NCBI GEO or SRA for US-based journals.

About three weeks back, we started looking into various biological websites
and databases to learn what programs they use. After struggling with all kinds
of websites built with home-grown add-ons and so on, we decided to proceed
more systematically. We ranked all databases and information sites according
to their usage, and then investigate them from top to bottom. However, our
original mission got sidetracked after we made a startling discovery during
the ranking process (based on [alexa](http://www.alexa.com)). We found that
upstart web-forums like [biostar](http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/biostars.org)
and seqanswers have similar or better traffic ranking than decade-old flybase,
yeast database (SGD) and arabidopsis database (TAIR). You may say that it is
unfair to compare boutique shops like model organism database with discussion
forums, but, we thought such comparison would help genomic websites to find
ideas about how to get the community involved, and make the annotation tasks
easier. In the past, we had some bad experience of building a genomic
database, where the manager of the project treated it like his personal
fiefdom and was very much against getting the community involved ( "Why are
you contacting our competitors? You will only upload data generated by our
group !", "We do not want to put a wiki for genes, because nobody has time to
add any text there", etc.).

We got curious enough about Biostar to contact [Istvan
Albert](http://www.personal.psu.edu/iua1/) to learn more. Istvan was in a good
mood, partly because [Biostar reached 10,000 question mark around the same
time](http://www.biostars.org/p/72506/), and entertained our questions. We
seriously underestimated Istvan at first. We thought he installed the program
from somewhere else, and even after learning that it was written by 'biostar
developers', we assumed that the [young kid in the
team](https://github.com/pindia) wrote the entire code. That assumption was
incorrect and we came out very impressed after talking to him. Wish we did our
homework and knew that [he used to write PRLs in his past
life](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10990882) ([arxiv
here](http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/9912336.pdf)).

Our curiousity about Biostar did not stop there and we sought opinions from
few other extensive users, non-users and quitter. We even made a pseudo-
account ourselves to ask questions and collect points. There was [a complaint
at stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16994465/read-a-protein-
fasta-file-and-splitting-the-read-string-at-argininer-and-then) about Biostar
people being rude, and we wanted to find out how the forum feels to a newbie.

In the next few commentaries, we will be writing about Biostar and then
continue on to discuss other biological databases. We [opened a new
section](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/software/) in our blog for those
information-related websites, whereas this space will continue to be used to
write about algorithms. Biostar will be covered in four parts, because it is
intriguing in many respects.
