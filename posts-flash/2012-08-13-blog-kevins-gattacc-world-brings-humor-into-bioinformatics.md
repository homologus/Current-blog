We updated our [list of bioinformatics
blogs](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/2012/07/27/how-to-stay-current-in-
bioinformaticsgenomics/) with a new one that we should not have missed -
[Kevin's GATTACCA world](http://kevin-gattaca.blogspot.com/).
<!--more-->

It was the first bioinformatics blog we ever read long before most others
mentioned in our list were born. Then we forgot about it until rediscovering
the blog somewhat fortuitously.

How, do you want to know? We were going through a set of T-cell diversity
sequences, and ran google on a motif. A variation of the motif took us to the
[movie GATTACCA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gattaca) as well as Kevin's
blog.

Kevin writes a lot on bioinformatics and programming, but even if you do not
want to read codes, he can make you laugh with his coverage of bioinformatics
ads, such as [here](http://kevin-gattaca.blogspot.com/2011/11/employment-ads-
do-you-have-mad-ngs.html) and [here](http://kevin-gattaca.blogspot.com/2012/06
/bioinformatician-data-finish-quality.html).
