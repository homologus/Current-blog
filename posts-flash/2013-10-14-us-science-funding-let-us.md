**The Shutdown Game**
<!--more-->

Let us play a number-guessing game. Pick a number between 1 and 1000. Did you
select 723? If not, you are a loser and the game is over !!

If you think the whole point of the game is to make you feel bad, check the
following figure. That is how unlikely NSF (National Science Foundation) is to
get shut down in its entirety, if one throws random darts on the chart. Try it
yourself by printing out the original from
[here](http://labs.enigma.io/shutdown2013/).

The whole point of the 'shutdown' is to make scientists feel bad, and the
process is highly targeted. If government agencies were closed
indiscriminately, a much smaller fraction of NSF would have been closed.
