> RNA-Seq assembly facilitates the study of transcriptomes for species without
sequenced genomes, but it is challenging to select the most accurate assembly
in this context. To address this challenge, we developed a model-based score,
RSEM-EVAL, for evaluating assemblies when the ground truth is unknown. Our
experiments show that RSEM-EVAL correctly reflects assembly accuracy, as
measured by REF-EVAL, a refined set of ground-truth-based scores that we also
developed. With the guidance of RSEM-EVAL, we assembled the transcriptome of
the regenerating axolotl limb; this assembly compares favorably to a previous
assembly.
