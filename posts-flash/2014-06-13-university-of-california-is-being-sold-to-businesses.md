> UC Regents recently approved a new corporate entity that will likely give a
group of well-connected businesspeople control over how academic research is
used.

Despite the sweeping changes the program portends for UC, the regents vote
received virtually no press coverage. UC plans to first implement Newco at
UCLA and its medical centers, but some regents, along with influential
business leaders across the state, want similar entities installed at
Berkeley, Davis, Santa Cruz, and other campuses. UC Regents Chairwoman Sherry
Lansing called Newco at UCLA a pilot program for the entire UC system.

Records show that wealthy investors and influential businessmen with close
ties to UCLA and one of the UC Regents Alan C. Mendelson are financially
invested in companies that currently license university-owned patents under
exclusive financial arrangements. Mendelson, who also is a trustee for the UC
Berkeley Foundation and has investments of his own in businesses that profit
from university-produced research, was one of the main backers of the Newco
proposal and cast a vote in favor of it.
