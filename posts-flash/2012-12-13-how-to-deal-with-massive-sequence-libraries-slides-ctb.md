In earlier commentaries, we presented
[slides](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/2012/10/02/big-collection-of-
bioinformative-slides-from-c-titus-brown/) and talks from C. Titus Brown, who
is working on very big NGS libraries. How big? His 50TB library set would need
500TB server to run Velvet !! Yes, we are talking about 500TB RAM, not hard
disk. We offered to rent him one such machine for only 5 T dollars/hour, but
he came up with other ideas.

Note: What first two slides said is not at all clear to us. Please start from
3rd one.

Update:

We also found a video of him talking at a different conference on similar
ideas -
