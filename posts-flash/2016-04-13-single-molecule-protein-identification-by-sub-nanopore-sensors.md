> Recent advances in top-down mass spectrometry enabled identification of
intact proteins, but this technology still faces challenges. For example, top-
down mass spectrometry suffers from a lack of sensitivity since the ion counts
for a single fragmentation event are often low. In contrast, nanopore
technology is exquisitely sensitive to single intact molecules, but it has
only been successfully applied to DNA sequencing, so far. Here, we explore the
potential of sub-nanopores for single-molecule protein identification (SMPI)
and describe an algorithm for analyzing the electrical current blockade signal
(nanospectrum) resulting from the translocation of a denaturated, linearly
charged protein through a sub-nanopore. We further describe the first SMPI
algorithm, compute the p-values of Protein-Nanospectrum Matches, and discuss
the promise and computational limitations of the current SMPI technology.
