> While metagenomics has emerged as a technology of choice for analyzing
bacterial populations, assembly of metagenomic data remains difficult thus
stifling biological discoveries. metaSPAdes is a new assembler that addresses
the challenge of metagenome analysis and capitalizes on computational ideas
that proved to be useful in assemblies of single cells and highly polymorphic
diploid genomes. We benchmark metaSPAdes against other state-of-the-art
metagenome assemblers across diverse da-tasets and demonstrate that it results
in high-quality assemblies.
