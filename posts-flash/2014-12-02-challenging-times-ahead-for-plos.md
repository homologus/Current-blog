[Scholarly kitchen blog](http://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2014/12/02/peak-
plos-planning-for-a-future-of-declining-revenue/) posted an interesting chart
showing publication output of PLOS One. Apparently, the number of papers
dropped 25% in one year from the peak in December 2013. (h/t:

PLOS One experienced meteoric growth between 2010 and 2013, and it was well
expected that the growth would slow down. However, the rapidity and extent of
decline suggest something else is afoot.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------

**They did ring a bell at the top**

The timing of the peak itself is curious, because it coincides with the month
of Randy Schekman's appeal to scientists to reject Cell/Nature/Science.
Schekman did not mention PLOS One in his letter, but he made a strong case for
rejecting journal impact factor and selectivity and promoted a publishing
model that should have given PLOS One big boost. That is no coincidence given
that he was convinced about the merits of this new publishing model by his
colleague and PLOS founder Mike Eisen.

> These journals aggressively curate their brands, in ways more conducive to
selling subscriptions than to stimulating the most important research. Like
fashion designers who create limited-edition handbags or suits, they know
scarcity stokes demand, so they artificially restrict the number of papers
they accept. The exclusive brands are then marketed with a gimmick called
"impact factor" a score for each journal, measuring the number of times its
papers are cited by subsequent research. Better papers, the theory goes, are
cited more often, so better journals boast higher scores. Yet it is a deeply
flawed measure, pursuing which has become an end in itself and is as damaging
to science as the bonus culture is to banking.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Why this sharp decline?**

An endorsement from Nobel Laureate should have given PLOS One a big boost, but
instead its publications topped in the same month and declined ahead. To
explain why, [Scholarly Kitchen
blog](http://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2014/12/02/peak-plos-planning-for-a
-future-of-declining-revenue/) suggested a number of reasons and we will add
one more.

**1\. Competition**

Now that the open-access online publication model gained its acceptance, a
large number of competitors of PLOS One have come into the fray. They include
-

(i) [BMC (owned by Springer)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BioMed_Central),

(ii) [Frontiers](http://www.frontiersin.org/),

(iii) [Nature Reports](http://www.nature.com/srep/index.html)

(iv) [Elife](http://elifesciences.org/) (backed by HHMI),

(v) [PeerJ](https://peerj.com/)

(vi) [GigaScience](http://www.gigasciencejournal.com/) (backed by BGI).

Moreover, the traditional journals are allowing open-access option and some
researchers find that attractive. Finally, if everything else fails, there is
always the possibility of placing the preprint in [arxiv](http://arxiv.org/)
or [biorxiv](http://biorxiv.org/) to make it openly accessible. Traditional
closed-access journals are becoming less relaxed about chasing and removing
those preprints.

However, competition alone does not explain the rapid drop of PLOS One papers.

**2\. More restrictive data policy**

Scholarly Kitchen blog discussed whether the newly implemented data policy of
PLOS journals had any impact and came to the following conclusion.

> Based on the graph, the effect of PLOS data sharing policy, implemented in
March 2014 does not seem to be driving authors away en masse. However, the
policy does not appear to be enforced by the publisher, at least at this time.
If the policies were implemented as a requirementwith publication withheld
until compliance, as the reviewer form clearly states it may also have an
impact on the the journal submission preference of PLOS authors.

**3\. Funding - stimulus has run its course**

The issue of science funding was not discussed in the Scholarly Kitchen
article, but could be the most dominant factor. In 2009, US and European
scientists received huge boost from post-financial crash stimulus spending.
Papers written with that excess funding came into the system in 2011-2013 and
many were likely published in PLOS One.

Now that the science funding situation has become more restrictive, it is
possible that the total number of papers submitted to PLOS One has also
fallen. Moreover, with reduced funding, the researchers have become cautious
about publication fee, whereas it was considered an acceptable cost of doing
business in the past.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Will PLOS Survive?**

PLOS One still receives and publishes a large number of papers, and therefore
it is too early to discuss the survival of the organization. However, we like
to point out that a number of factors helping PLOS gain its prominence may act
like Achilles' heel during its period of decline and reorganization.

**1\. Non-profit status**

The point of PLOS being organized as non-profit has often been mentioned by
Mike Eisen as its distinguishing factor compared to Springer, Wiley and other
commercial ventures, but being non-profit has its own drawbacks. Scholarly
Kitchen [wrote](http://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2014/12/02/peak-plos-
planning-for-a-future-of-declining-revenue/) \-

> Unlike commercial ventures, non-profit organizations are constrained with
what they can do with surplus cash and still retain their non-profit tax-
exempt status. PLOS has no stockholders who insist on being rewarded with
quarterly dividends. PLOS was started with foundation grants, not venture
capital from investors, who wait eagerly to cash-in on the spoils of
scientific publishing. In 2013, PLOS did what other non-profit publishers in
their situation would do with a lot of extra cashthey invested in their
organization. According to their financial report, PLOS invested by building
infrastructure, hiring more staff and increasing the size of their US and UK
offices.

While these investments sound wise, we need to remember that all of this
infrastructure is based on a stream of APCs that now appears to be in flux.

**2\. Lack of character, reputation, 'impact factor' or whatever you call it**

Most traditional topical journals have their own characters in terms of
subjects being covered, and that character is often determined by the vision,
interests and reputation of the founding editors. For example, the journal
Bioinformatics only covers articles on bioinformatics algorithms, whwreas
[Biology Direct](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology_Direct), one of our
favorite journals, contains detailed articles and reviews on various topics
related to evolutionary genomics. The later journal was started by Eugene
Koonin, Laura Landweber and David J. Lipman, respected biologists working in
related areas. Non-topical journals like Nature, Science and Cell, on the
other hand, rely on their selectivity and wide readership.

PLOS One went after this second market and branded itself as non-selective,
non-topical journal. Moreover, it neutralized the 'wide readership' plus point
of Nature, Science and Cell with its own 'open access' campaign, supposedly
implying wide readership due to ease of access.

That worked well, but now that open access has become the mantra of almost all
journals, how does PLOS distinguish itself from other burgeoning open-access
competitors? There are only three ways for a journal to compete - (i)
reputation of editors, (ii) cost and (iii) technology, and among those (ii)
and (iii) seem to be the most viable options for PLOS. Competing based on cost
of publishing is a dead-end road, and therefore the strongest winning point
for PLOS could have been competing in terms of superior technology.

**3\. Location in California and Chinese Competition**

PLOS was founded in 2000, when California, its place of founding, had huge
technological lead over other parts of the world. The strategies taken by the
journal benefited strongly from that technological advantage. That lead has
fallen off and California has now become too expensive for tech-heavy
organizations. Gigascience, a journal started by BGI, built
[GigaDB](http://gigadb.org/) for submission of large genomic data sets
associated with published papers. We expected PLOS to use similar innovative
steps to maintain its advantage over competing journals, but the cost of
replicating the same is possibly too high in California.

The evolution of PLOS from here onward will be interesting to watch. Why the
number of publications fell sharply, whether the decline will continue and
what strategies the organization will take to bring down the costs and compete
effectively are all important factors to determine its fate. Moreover, if
decline of funding is the true cause of fall in published papers, other
journals should see impact sooner or later. It seems obvious that the biology
space has too many journals and will benefit from a round of 'creative
destruction' imposed by shortfall in funding.
