In [The Drugs Dont Work, but Open Publication Will Not Fix
Them](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/students/2012/09/23/the-drugs-dont-work-and-
open-source-will-not-make-them-work/), we wrote about an informative book
titled Bad Pharma: How Drug Companies Mislead Doctors and Harm Patients' by
Ben Goldacre. Readers will enjoy the following Ted talk by the same

If you have longer time, [listen to this podcast with Ben
Goldacre](http://www.onthemedia.org/2013/jul/05/) about reporting on medical
science -

> A special hour of stories about reporting on medical science. The
misreporting of the effect of vaccines on autism, tracking retractions in
medical journals, and a century old hoax that went uncorrected for forty
years.

In the Ted talk and podcast, Ben Goldacre compared misleading research by
Pharma companies with high standards maintained by academic journals and
academic conferences, where experts get to the truth by asking critical
questions. Ironically, his book came out in the same month as the publication
of ENCODE papers.

Even more unusual, it took us 2000 tweets to make that simple observation :)
