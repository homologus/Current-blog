[Veli Mkinen from University of
Helsinki](http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/vmakinen/) (and Belazzougui, Cunial,
Tomescu) wrote a book titled 'Genome-Scale Algorithm Design: Biological
Sequence Analysis in the Era of High-Throughput Sequencing'. I have not read
the book yet, but based on reading papers from his group, I expect it to be an
insightful one.
