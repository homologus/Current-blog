I had quite a bit of interest in high-Tc superconductivity. It was the first
giant bubble I experienced before moving to silly-con valley in the dot-com
era. Despite pouring of immense amount of money, the theory of high-Tc
superconductivity remained unknown.

A new paper claims to have made progress in that respect and is worth reading.

[Intra-unit-cell Nematic Density Wave: Unified Broken-Symmetry of the Cuprate
Pseudogap State](http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.0362)

> The identity of the fundamental broken symmetry (if any) in the cuprate
pseudogap state is unresolved. In fact, two apparently distinct forms of
electronic symmetry breaking, one of intra-unit-cell rotational symmetry (Q=0
nematic) and the other of lattice translational symmetry (Q?0 density wave),
are reported extensively. However, indications of linkage between these two
phenomena suggest the prospect of a unified fundamental description, with one
intriguing possibility being an intra-unit-cell nematic density wave. Here we
carry out site-specific measurements within each CuO2 unit-cell, segregating
the results into three separate electronic structure images containing only
the Cu sites (Cu(r)) and only the x/y-axis O sites (Ox(r) and Oy(r)). Phase
resolved Fourier analysis reveals directly that the incommensurate modulations
in the Ox(r) and Oy(r) sublattice images consistently exhibit a relative phase
of ?. We confirm this discovery on two highly distinct cuprate compounds,
ruling out tunnel matrix-element and materials specific systematics. These
observations demonstrate by direct sublattice phase-resolved visualization
that the cuprate density wave consists essentially of spatial modulations of
the intra-unit-cell nematicity; this state can equally well be described as an
intra-unit-cell density wave with a d-symmetry form factor.

Wired magazine sheds some light on the discovery. We recommend you to skip the
first seven and last seven paragraphs and stick to the middle of the report -

[Scientists May Have Decoded One of the Secrets to
Superconductors](http://www.wired.com/2014/05/scientists-may-have-decoded-one-
of-the-secrets-to-superconductors/)

> The microbes in this case are ripples of electrons inside the
superconductors that are called charge density waves. The fine-grained
structure of the waves, reported in two new papers by independent groups of
researchers, suggests that they may be driven by the same force as
superconductivity. Davis and his colleagues directly visualized the waves in a
study posted online in April, corroborating indirect evidence reported in
February by a team led by Riccardo Comin, a postdoctoral fellow at the
University of Toronto.

Its a beautiful paper, said Dirk Morr, a professor of physics at the
University of Illinois, Chicago, speaking of the work of Davis and his
colleagues. One can really trust this result and build our theories from it.

Subir Sachdev, a professor of physics at Harvard University who helped devise
Davis study, correctly predicted the form of the charge density waves in a
paper last year, which detailed a possible mechanism behind both the waves and
high-temperature superconductivity. Though further tests are needed, Sachdevs
theory is garnering support from many experts, who say it succinctly captures
key features of the materials.

Taken together, the various findings are at last starting to build a
comprehensive picture of the physics behind high-temperature
superconductivity. This is the first time I feel like were making real
progress, said Andrea Damascelli, a professor of physics at the University of
British Columbia who led two recent studies on charge density waves. A lot of
different observations which have been made over decades did not make sense
with each other, and now they do.
