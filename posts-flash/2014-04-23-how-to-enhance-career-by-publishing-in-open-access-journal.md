We previously asked about what arguments to use to convince co-authors to
publish their preprints at arxiv/biorxiv.

A new blog post by impactstory covers the next step of the process, which is
to convince everyone to publish in "Megajournals", or open-access online
journals like PLOS One, BMJ open, etc.

[The Perils of Megajournalsand How to Avoid
Them](http://www.socialsciencespace.com/2014/04/the-perils-of-megajournals-
and-how-to-avoid-them/)

In an ideal world, where a paper is published should not be an issue, because
you are judged by your intellectual contributions, right? Sadly, many
superficial academics still decide whether a paper is good or bad based on
journal, citation count, # of retweets, university of researchers and so on.
If you are in that kind of business, the linked article addresses the
following points to help you.

1\. My co-authors wont want to publish in megajournals

2\. No one in my field will find out about it

3\. My CV will look like I couldnt publish in good journals

Enjoy !!

(and always remember, a highly cited flawed paper is still a flawed paper).
