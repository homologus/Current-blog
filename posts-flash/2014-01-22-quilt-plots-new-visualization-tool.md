Background

Graphical representation of data is one of the most easily comprehended forms
of explanation. The current study describes a simple visualization tool which
may allow greater understanding of medical and epidemiological data.

Method

We propose a simple tool for visualization of data, known as a quilt plot,
that provides an alternative to presenting large volumes of data as frequency
tables. Data from the Australian Needle and Syringe Program survey are used to
illustrate quilt plots.

Conclusion

Visualization of large volumes of data using quilt plots enhances
interpretation of medical and epidemiological data. Such intuitive
presentations are particularly useful for the rapid assessment of problems in
the data which cannot be readily identified by manual review. We recommend
that, where possible, quilt plots be used along with traditional quantitative
assessments of the data as an explanatory data analysis tool.
