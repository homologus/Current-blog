[A new and 'controversial' paper by Eran
Elhaik](http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2013-01/oup-nss011413.php) came
out recently in [Genome Biology and Evolution](http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/c
ontent/early/2012/12/14/gbe.evs119.abstract).

> Despite being one of the most genetically analysed groups, the origin of
European Jews has remained obscure. However, a new study published online
today (Thursday) in the journal Genome Biology and Evolution by Dr Eran
Elhaik, a geneticist at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, argues that
the European Jewish genome is a mosaic of Caucasus, European, and Semitic
ancestries, setting to rest previous contradictory reports of Jewish ancestry.
Elhaik's findings strongly support the Khazarian Hypothesis, as opposed to the
Rhineland Hypothesis, of European Jewish origins. This could have a major
impact on the ways in which scientists study genetic disorders within the
population.

The paper had been around in [arxiv.org for
months](http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.1092), but we failed to take notice. Here is
the abstract.

> The question of Jewish ancestry has been the subject of controversy for over
two centuries and has yet to be resolved. The "Rhineland Hypothesis" proposes
that Eastern European Jews emerged from a small group of German Jews who
migrated eastward and expanded rapidly. Alternatively, the "Khazarian
Hypothesis" suggests that Eastern European descended from Judean tribes who
joined the Khazars, an amalgam of Turkic clans that settled the Caucasus in
the early centuries CE and converted to Judaism in the 8th century. The
Judaized Empire was continuously reinforced with Mesopotamian and Greco-Roman
Jews until the 13th century. Following the collapse of their empire, the
Judeo-Khazars fled to Eastern Europe. The rise of European Jewry is therefore
explained by the contribution of the Judeo-Khazars. Thus far, however, their
contribution has been estimated only empirically; the absence of genome-wide
data from Caucasus populations precluded testing the Khazarian Hypothesis.
Recent sequencing of modern Caucasus populations prompted us to revisit the
Khazarian Hypothesis and compare it with the Rhineland Hypothesis. We applied
a wide range of population genetic analyses - including principal component,
biogeographical origin, admixture, identity by descent, allele sharing
distance, and uniparental analyses - to compare these two hypotheses. Our
findings support the Khazarian Hypothesis and portray the European Jewish
genome as a mosaic of Caucasus, European, and Semitic ancestries, thereby
consolidating previous contradictory reports of Jewish ancestry.

Why controversial? Thanks for asking. The topic of Khazars is a good example
of modern day battle between religion, politics and science. 'Religion' and
'politics' want Khazars to go away, but 'science' keeps throwing cold water
into their grand plans. If you want to read about these topics, the best book
to start with is [The Wandering Who by Gilad Atzmon](http://www.amazon.com
/The-Wandering-Who-Gilad-Atzmon/dp/1846948754/ref=pd_bxgy_b_img_z). Also, [The
Thirteenth Tribe: The Kazar Empire and Its Heritage by Arthur
Koestler](http://www.amazon.com/The-Thirteenth-Tribe-Empire-
Heritage/dp/0445042427/ref=pd_sim_b_5) and [The Invention of the Jewish People
by Shlomo Sand](http://www.amazon.com/Invention-Jewish-People-Shlomo-
Sand/dp/1844676234/ref=pd_sim_b_1) are supposedly informative, but we have not
completed them yet.
