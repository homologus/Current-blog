> It's official. Russian scientists announced today that they have reached
Antarctica's Lake Vostok, an ancient, liquid lake the size of Lake Ontario
buried beneath more than 2 miles (3 kilometers) of ice for at least 14 million
years.

> Scientists suspect that the massive lake could house cold-loving organisms
uniquely adapted to live in the darkness under the ice. The lake has been cut
off from the outside world since the ice sheet covered it as long as 34
million years ago, or, according to the most modest estimates, 14 million
years ago.
