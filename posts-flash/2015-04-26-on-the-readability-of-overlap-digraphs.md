> We introduce the graph parameter readability and study it as a function of
the number of vertices in a graph. Given a digraph D, an injective overlap
labeling assigns a unique string to each vertex such that there is an arc from
x to y if and only if x properly overlaps y. The readability of D is the
minimum string length for which an injective overlap labeling exists. In
applications that utilize overlap digraphs (e.g., in bioinformatics),
readability reflects the length of the strings from which the overlap digraph
is constructed. We study the asymptotic behaviour of readability by casting it
in purely graph theoretic terms (without any reference to strings). We prove
upper and lower bounds on readability for certain graph families and general
graphs.
