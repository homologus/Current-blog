On July 20, two major companies reported earning. The stock market cheered the
results immediately, but reversed in short order.

In retrospect, it appears that the event also marked the top for major US
stock indices and biotech sector.

What else happened on July 20?

[IP Group Says Oxford Nanopore Raises GBP70 Million In Funding Round](http://w

Raises_GBP70_Million_In_Funding_Round)

> LONDON (Alliance News) - FTSE 250-listed intellectual property company IP
Group PLC on Tuesday said its Oxford Nanopore Technologies Ltd portfolio
company has raised GBP70 million in a new financing round.

Oxford Nanopore is an Oxford University spin-out focused on nanopore-based
electronic molecular analysis systems.

Following the completion of the financing found, which attracted existing and
new investors in the UK, US and Europe, IP Group's undiluted stake of 19.9% in
Oxford Nanopore is now valued at GBP192.9 million, representing an unrealised
fair value gain for IP Group on its investment of GBP50.3 million.

IP invested another GBP13.9 million in Oxford Nanopore in the latest funding
round.

"IP Group has been proud to support Oxford Nanopore since the company's
formation ten years ago. The company has made excellent technical and
commercial progress and the significant developments announced at its recent
London Calling nanopore-sensing conference further reinforce our confidence in
the company's technology," said IP Group Chief Executive Alan Aubrey.

If July 20 was indeed the turning point for stock indices and biotech sector,
these smart investors seemed to have bought the top !! It will be interesting
to watch what they do at the eventual bottom.
