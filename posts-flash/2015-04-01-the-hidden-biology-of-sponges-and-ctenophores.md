Ctenophores or sponges are the sister group to all other animals.

Biases hide some complex traits in these animals and make them appear simpler
than they are.

These biases supported the misconception that living animals represent grades
of complexity.

It is critical to investigate the unique but hidden biology of ctenophores and
sponges.

Animal evolution is often presented as a march toward complexity, with
different living animal groups each representing grades of organization that
arose through the progressive acquisition of complex traits. There are now
many reasons to reject this classical hypothesis. Not only is it incompatible
with recent phylogenetic analyses, but it is also an artifact of hidden
biology, that is, blind spots to complex traits in non-model species. A new
hypothesis of animal evolution, where many complex traits have been repeatedly
gained and lost, is emerging. As we discuss here, key details of this new
model hinge on a better understanding of the Porifera and Ctenophora, which
have each been hypothesized to be sister to all other animals, but are poorly
studied and often misrepresented.
