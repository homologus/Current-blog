How does this conspiracy of genes work? said Eric Lander to describe the
latest epigenome project [to New York Times reporter Gina
Kolata](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/19/health/scientists-shed-light-on-
circuits-that-control-genes.html). Conspiracy seems like a curious choice of
word, because we are unsure which
[definition](http://www.thefreedictionary.com/conspiracy) applies here.

> 1\. An agreement to perform together an illegal, wrongful, or subversive
act.

2\. A group of conspirators.

3\. Law - An agreement between two or more persons to commit a crime or
accomplish a legal purpose through illegal action.

4\. A joining or acting together, as if by sinister design: a conspiracy of
wind and tide that devastated coastal areas.

We would have had to scratch our heads less, if Lander used 'conspiracy of
epigenome' instead. Nothing managed to derail this expensive boondoggle over
the last four years, including powerful critics of the scientific principle
behind it, fraud allegation against the leader, public humiliation of its
sister project ENCODE, NIH cost-cutting and protest of the scientists, and so
on. What appears even more puzzling is that despite all those prior events,
the 'leaders' of the epigenome project ended up making the same mistakes as
ENCODE. Don't these clowns learn anything?

Speaking of history of the epigenome project -

1\. When the original project was launched, Mark Ptashne, Oliver Hobert and
Eric Davidson disputed the scientific validity of the project using very
strong words ([Questions over the scientific basis of epigenome
project](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v464/n7288/full/464487c.html)).
In the field of gene regulations, each of them is important in his own right.
Oliver Hobert works on gene regulatory mechanisms of neural system, and his
2011 Cell paper - 'Transgenerational Inheritance of an Acquired Small RNA-
Based Antiviral Response in C. elegans' shows one rare example of epigenetic
mechanisms in animals. Eric Davidson is among the most respected developmental
biologists, who works on gene regulatory mechanisms in early embryo. Mark
Ptashne was the first scientist to demonstrate DNA-protein binding, in his
1967 paper "Specific Binding of the ? Phage Repressor to ? DNA". Criticism
from even one of them would be enough to raise eyebrows about a scientific
project, but the epigenome project mysteriously managed to survive all three.

They were not the only ones. Ptashne et al wrote -

> A letter signed by eight prominent scientists (not including us), and an
associated petition signed by more than 50, went into these matters in greater
detail, and expressed serious reservations about the scientific basis of the
epigenome project.

2\. In another unexpected blow, Manolis Kellis, the leader of the epigenome
project, was accused of fraud by Berkeley mathematician Lior Pachter (check
[here](https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2014/02/11/the-network-nonsense-of-
manolis-kellis/) and [here](https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2014/02/12/why-i
-read-the-network-nonsense-papers/)). In the scientific world, a fraud
allegation is far more serious than someone's scientific theory being called
wrong, yet nothing happened in this case. Given that Pachter is a very good
and well-respected scientist, why was his case completely ignored?

3\. ENCODE, its sister project, was publicly shamed for its media splash and
hyped up claims by respected population geneticist Dan Graur. (Check ["On the
immortality of television sets: function in the human genome according to the
evolution-free gospel of
ENCODE"](http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2013/02/20/gbe.evt028)).
The ENCODE-backers called Graur's 'tone' rude, but respected scientists like
[Gary Ruvkun](http://judgestarling.tumblr.com/post/96390259076/national-
academy-of-science-member-on-encode) said that he was too gentle and used even
stronger words. Here is the comment Ruvkun left in Graur's blog.

> I have enjoyed your devastating critiques of Encode and ModEncode. I
forwarded your On the immortality of television sets to dozens. But you are
too gentle here. I get Nature now for free, since I review quite a bit for
themit is a sign of the decline of journals and the decline of the science
that they publish that they now give it away to their reviewerssort of like
the discounted subscriptions for magazines which sell high end merchandise if
you live in the right zip code. So, I was well rested today and decided to
give the 5 papers of the modEncode a chance to blow me away. Not one
interesting finding. Not one. Worse than junk food, which at least satisfy in
the moment. Hundreds of millions of dollars on genome scale observations of
transcripts and transcription factor binding. Grind up a whole animal and look
at the average of hundreds of cell types pooled together. A few weak
correlations between this and that transcription factor. A few differentially
spliced mRNAs. I would say that about 1% of the modEncode budget was
appropriate for getting better transcript annotation, but the rest was
misguided genomics. A waste of research dollars! The so-called brain trust of
the NIH does not understand the difference between big science that is
foreverthe thousands of genome sequences that are precise to one part in a
billion and will be used for the rest of timeand big science datasets that
will simply fade away because they are so imprecise and uninteresting to
anyone, like RNA seq. On the other hand, the good news about projects such as
these is that the hundreds of authors on those papers are distracted from
serious science, and the bizarre sexiness of these papers attracts other
marginal intellects to those fields, and thus fields that are important
becomes much less competitive, ignoring the bloated budgets of these Soviet-
style five-year plans.

4\. ENCODE made a big climb-down from its position that 80% of human genome
was functional. Given that it was supposed ENCODE's earth-shattering
discovery, ENCODE appeared to have discovered nothing and ended up being the
most expensive 'resource paper'. The statistical paper backing ENCODE's
primary claim [was strongly disputed by Nicolas Bray and Lior
Pachter](http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.3076).

> Ward and Kellis (Reports, September 5 2012) identify regulatory regions in
the human genome exhibiting lineage-specific constraint and estimate the
extent of purifying selection. There is no statistical rationale for the
examples they highlight, and their estimates of the fraction of the genome
under constraint are biased by arbitrary designations of completely
constrained regions.

Note the name Kellis there? He is the leader of the epigenome project.

5\. After the huge waste of $350M by ENCODE, scientists are up in arm against
all such expensive its huge price tag of $350M. [The controversy section of
ENCODE's wiki page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENCODE#Controversy) is now
bigger than every other section, and you cannot imagine what scientists say in
private.

\-----------------------------------------------

Despite all these, the $250M epigenome project came out with another media
splash and public claim of major discovery, as if ENCODE never happened.
Reuters reports -

[Scientists unveil map of 'epigenome,' a second genetic
code](http://www.trust.org/item/20150218120047-ujnx1)

A second genetic code???? Please note that these articles are usually handed
by university's internal team to the reporters. So, we should not blame the
reporters for misunderstanding science.

If you do not believe it, here is the leader of the project showing he is no
better.

> "A lifetime of environmental factors and lifestyle factors" influence the
epigenome, including smoking, exercising, diet, exposure to toxic chemicals
and even parental nurturing, **Kellis** said in an interview. Not only will
scientists have to decipher how the epigenome affects genes, they will also
have to determine how the lives people lead affect their epigenome.

Why not add victims of holocaust and slavery as well, like the [paper
mentioned in this post](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/blog/2014/07/23
/epigenetics-explained-in-the-context-of-descendants-of-holocaust-and-slavery-
victims/). Needless to say, not a single claim is backed by any science. We
have gone through many of the relevant studies, and they were often based on
poor-quality association studies of 30 or 40 persons and no further study of
causal mechanism.

The article further says -

> "The only way you can deliver on the promise of precision medicine is by
including the epigenome," said Manolis Kellis of the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology, who led the mapping that involved scientists in labs from
Croatia to Canada and the United States.

Given that 'precision medicine' and 'epigenome' are both vaporwares, there is
no doubt that one will help with delivery of the promise of the other.

In this entire media circus, the only truth is spoken by Anshul Kundaje
(emphasis ours) -

> But while the researchers are confident that their discoveries will be
revelatory, they also see a long road ahead. They will find circuits, another
author, Anshul Kundaje, an assistant professor of genetics at Stanford said.
But, he added: **Making sense of them is a whole different story.**

In other words, nobody understands what is going on, but they all agree that
they made a major discovery ('second genetic code'). Apart from resorting to
conspiracies, as Lander did, can anyone provide a sane explanation of how this
freak show is sustained?
