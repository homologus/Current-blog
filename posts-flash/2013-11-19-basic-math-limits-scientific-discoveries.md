'Scientific discovery' often constitutes of describing natural phenomena using
a scientific language. For physical sciences, mathematics is that language of
choice. Therefore, if the mathematics of a civilization does not have certain
tools in its toolbox, explaining natural phenomena becomes increasingly
difficult. In the same vein, when mathematics stops growing, a long dark age
follows despite apparent prosperity built on the foundation on previous
progress in mathematics.

[In an earlier commentary](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/students/2012/12/02
/how-did-the-romans-do-multiplication-44-b-c/), we talked about how ancient
Romans multiplied numbers using their Roman numerals. The process shown in
professor Fekete's page was quite elaborate and possibly created hindrance for
further improvement of Roman science. A bigger reason for the lack of progress
of Roman science was their general dislike of mathematicians and philosophers.
Romans were very practical, who saw mathematicians and philosophers as
unproductive people wasting time on abstract concepts. In reality, ancient
Greeks greatly expanded the frontier of mathematics (geometry), and that
foundation supported giant Roman constructions.

Speaking of mathematics, here is what ancient Greeks discovered and did not
discover.

**Geometry**

Development of geometry was the biggest achievement of ancient Greeks. Greeks
saw their world in terms of geometrical figures. So, everything their
mathematicians derived were based on such constructs.

Borrowing from wiki -

> In the 7th century BC, the Greek mathematician Thales of Miletus used
geometry to solve problems such as calculating the height of pyramids and the
distance of ships from the shore. He is credited with the first use of
deductive reasoning applied to geometry, by deriving four corollaries to
Thales' Theorem.[10] Pythagoras established the Pythagorean School, which is
credited with the first proof of the Pythagorean theorem,[11] though the
statement of the theorem has a long history[12][13] Eudoxus (408c.355 BC)
developed the method of exhaustion, which allowed the calculation of areas and
volumes of curvilinear figures,[14] as well as a theory of ratios that avoided
the problem of incommensurable magnitudes, which enabled subsequent geometers
to make significant advances. Around 300 BC, geometry was revolutionized by
Euclid, whose Elements, widely considered the most successful and influential
textbook of all time,[15] introduced mathematical rigor through the axiomatic
method and is the earliest example of the format still used in mathematics
today, that of definition, axiom, theorem, and proof. Although most of the
contents of the Elements were already known, Euclid arranged them into a
single, coherent logical framework.[16] The Elements was known to all educated
people in the West until the middle of the 20th century and its contents are
still taught in geometry classes today.[17] Archimedes (c.287212 BC) of
Syracuse used the method of exhaustion to calculate the area under the arc of
a parabola with the summation of an infinite series, and gave remarkably
accurate approximations of Pi.[18] He also studied the spiral bearing his name
and obtained formulas for the volumes of surfaces of revolution.

**Numbers**

Greeks discovered rational numbers (ratio of integers), but chose not to
venture into irrational numbers despite being [dangerously
close](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrational_number#Ancient_Greece).

> Greek mathematicians termed this ratio of incommensurable magnitudes alogos,
or inexpressible. Hippasus, however, was not lauded for his efforts: according
to one legend, he made his discovery while out at sea, and was subsequently
thrown overboard by his fellow Pythagoreans for having produced an element in
the universe which denied thedoctrine that all phenomena in the universe can
be reduced to whole numbers and their ratios.[10] Another legend states that
Hippasus was merely exiled for this revelation. Whatever the consequence to
Hippasus himself, his discovery posed a very serious problem to Pythagorean
mathematics, since it shattered the assumption that number and geometry were
inseparablea foundation of their theory.

**Algebra**

Greek algebra was centered around geometry and did not develop into an
abstract field of mathematics like today.

**Calculus**

Although ancient Greeks never developed calculus in its modern form, they
developed a method that is fairly close to the concept of limit today. It is
known as [method of
exhaustion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_exhaustion), and Euclid
used it to derive a number of propositions in his book.

Proposition 2

The area of a circle is proportional to the square of its radius.

Proposition 5

The volumes of two tetrahedra of the same height are proportional to the areas
of their triangular bases.

Proposition 10

The volume of a cone is a third of the volume of the corresponding cylinder
which has the same base and height.

Proposition 11

The volume of a cone (or cylinder) of the same height is proportional to the
area of the base.

Proposition 12

The volume of a cone (or cylinder) that is the similar to another is
proportional to the cube of the ratio of the diameters of the bases.

Proposition 18

The volume of a sphere is proportional to the cube of its diameter.

Were the Greek mathematicians less intelligent than, say, Newton or Gauss? Not
at all. The best way to judge the discoveries of Ancient Greeks is to place
oneself in their environment and see advances made in that context. A kid
growing up in 3rd century BC was trained about certain mathematical facts, and
the farthest he could climb to was limited by where is started from.
Similarly, when a mathematician claimed to 'prove' something, the proof had to
be in the form of explaining an observation in the language of what the
culture knew or accepted. Therefore, it is not odd that Greeks did not
discover basic algebra or irrational numbers. Geometric objects formed the
core of Greek mathematics. So, any mathematical 'proof' had to be translated
into a statement about geometric objects, and that handicapped the abilities
of Greek mathematicians. Think about how far you can go, if you have to prove
everything in terms squares, circles, pentagons, lines and ellipses.

To learn about the next big leaps in mathematics, readers may take a look at
the biographies of [Liu Hui (3rd century AD
China)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liu_Hui), [Aryabhata (5th century AD
India)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata) in Indian golden age and [Omar
Khayyam (10th century AD
Iran)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m) in Islamic golden age.
After the Greeks, European mathematics progressed very little for over 1,500
years and that vacuum was partly due to Roman disaffection toward mathematics.
In that sense, death of abstract mathematics could be described as the early
indicator of dark age. European mathematics started to pick up again during
Renaissance, but Europeans had a lot to catch up with. Real advances started
after southern Europe was defeated in 80 years' war and [Peace of Westphalia
(1648)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_of_Westphalia) moved the center of
intellectual activity to northern Europe. Curious readers may check the
biographies of [Gauss](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss),
[Euler](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler),
[Newton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton),
[Leibnitz](http://fabpedigree.com/james/mathmen.htm#Leibniz) \- just to name a
few contributors. Bringing in the concept of imaginary numbers and tying it
with geometry was possibly the greatest contribution of mathematicians from
European golden era. Therefore, Feynman's description of [Euler's
formula](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler's_formula) as "our jewel" and "the
most remarkable formula in mathematics" was not an understatement.

Speaking of Newton, Subhramanyan Chandrasekhar wrote a book titled "Newton's
Principia for the Common Reader (Physics)" that is worth checking out. Robert
Golub [describes the book as](http://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0210097.pdf) \-

> Towards the end of his life the great astrophysicist Subrahmanyan
Chandrashekar wrote a very interesting, educational, and entertaining book
which was a readers guide to Newtons Principia (Newtons Principia for the
Common Reader , Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1995). Chandra characterized the
nature of his project in the prologue as an undertaking by a practising
scientist to read and comprehend the intellectual achievement that the
Principia is . The resulting book is a wonderful translation of Newtons
arguments into modern language and mathematical notation accompanied by
historical and physical commentary.

Sadly the book is out of print, because by the time he finished, the 'common
reader' curious about Newton or mathematics disappeared.
