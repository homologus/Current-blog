I also tried to learn alignment algorithms, and I read some papers from Nature
Reviews. But I was still confused after reading those papers.

I couldnt learn alignment algorithms as good as you. You know the development
of alignment algorithms, and you know intuitive feeling of the algorithm
development. I am a lot interested in how your learn, how you find the ideas
behind alignment algorithms.

Thanks Kevin for the compliment !!

The best way to understand the algorithms is to use
[Feynman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman) approach, which is to
stop reading papers and try very hard to design your own algorithm. Imagine
there is nothing out there and you are the first person to solve the problem.

Maybe you will find something really clever or maybe you will not, but the
process will orient your brain in such a way that when you go back to read
papers, you will appreciate the cleverness of other solutions very quickly.
