Please excuse sarcasm in our title, but every penny we spend to find genome
wide associations for every complex disease takes us away from finding the
real cause. That is not just our opinion, but everyone with a clue is starting
to realize that we are being guided by the 'streetlight effect' with cheap
sequencing. For example, check MIT professor M. B. Yaffe's comment here -

[Cancer Genomics and Parable of Streetlight
Effect](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/blog/2013/05/22/cancer-genomics-and-
parable-of-streetlight-effect/)

or check, Dr. King's comment in our earlier commentary -

[Genome Wide Association Studies (#GWAS) Are They
Replicable?](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/blog/2013/07/26/genome-wide-
association-studies-gwas-are-they-replicable/)

or Vogelstein in

Limited](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/03/health/research/dnas-power-to-
