> Last week I ran a one-day workshop on RNA-seq data analysis in the UVA
Health Sciences Library. I set up an AWS public EC2 image with all the
necessary software installed. Participants logged into AWS, launched the
image, and we kicked off the morning session with an introduction to the Unix
shell (taught by Jessica Bonnie, a biostatistician here in our genomics group,
and a fellow Software Carpentry instructor). I followed with a walkthrough of
using FastQC for quality assessment, FASTX toolkit for trimming, TopHat for
alignment, and featureCounts to summarize gene expression read counts at the
gene level. I started the afternoon session started with an introduction to R,
followed by a tutorial on analyzing the count data we generated in the first
part using DESeq2 in R.
