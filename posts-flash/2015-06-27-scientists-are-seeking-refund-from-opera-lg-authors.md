A few days back, Song Gao, Denis Bertrand and Niranjan Nagarajan posted a
paper titled 'OPERA-LG: Efficient and exact scaffolding of large, repeat-rich
eukaryotic genomes **with performance guarantees**' at biorxiv. We were
surprised at the 'performance guarantee' sales pitch in the title and
mentioned about it [in a blog
post](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/blog/2015/06/10/opera-lg-efficient-and-
exact-scaffolding-of-large-repeat-rich-eukaryotic-genomes-with-performance-
guarantees/).

Our reader Dmitry Antipov got excited about the software due to this guarantee
and decided to give it a try. Sadly, he came back very disappointed (see
comment below) and likes to get refund. Authors, please help.

> Software package is still very raw. For my data and version v2.0.2 it
crashes with vector::range check error, and even break the tmux session it was
run from.
