The software tool described in [this new arxiv
paper](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/06/27/021626) is exactly what we
need today for our work. It allows one to remove clutter from de novo RNAseq
assemblies.

> TransRate is a tool for reference-free quality assessment of de novo
transcriptome assemblies. Using only sequenced reads as the input, TransRate
measures the quality of individual contigs and whole assemblies, enabling
assembly optimization and comparison. TransRate can accurately evaluate
assemblies of conserved and novel RNA molecules of any kind in any species. We
show that it is more accurate than comparable methods and demonstrate its use
on a variety of data.
