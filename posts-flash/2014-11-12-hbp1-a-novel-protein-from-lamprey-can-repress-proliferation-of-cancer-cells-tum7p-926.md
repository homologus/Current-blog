not sure about the implications.

> HBP1 ( HMG-box containing protein 1) is homologous to the sequence- specific
high mobility group ( HMG) family of transcriptional factor. Previous work had
shown that HBP1 inhibits G1 progression in cells. In this paper, we identified
a homolog of HBP1 in the Japanese lamprey (Lampetra japonica). The
bioinformatics analyses showed that the Lj-hbp1 gene has over 60% sequence
identity with its homologs in jawed vertebrates. The open reading frame (ORF)
of Lj-HBP1 is 1584 bp long and encoded 527 amino acids. The calculated
molecular masses of Lj-HBP1 was 58 kD. Real-time quantitative PCR indicates
that the HBP1 appears universally in the lampreys tissues. An Adeno-X-LjHBP1
vector were constructed, HBP1 transcription factor were expressed, and its
infection efficiency of the packaged lentivirus were evaluated by PCR method.
We found that both human tumor cells and normal cells were infected
efficiently as determined by the expression of HBP1. In addition, the
proliferation rate and ability of growth in soft agar of the HBP1-transfected
Raji cells were suppressed through growth curve test ( population doubling as
index) and soft agar assay. The results indicated that modest overexpression
of HBP1 inhibited the growth of tumor cells.
