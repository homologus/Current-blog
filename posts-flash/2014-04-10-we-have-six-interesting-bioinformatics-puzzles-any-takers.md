Dear Readers,
<!--more-->

We have a number of interesting bioinformatics puzzles. They are more
biologically oriented, but anyone with knowledge of de Bruijn graphs and
computational analysis will find them exciting. These days, many smart
computer scientists are into bioinformatics and we are saddened to see so much
talent getting wasted in optimizing and benchmarking k-mer counters or
aligners.

Please contact us by email, if interested. They are just for fun, but most
likely you will be able to write a cool paper after solving them.

We will be away from here for a week, and be busy building [our RNAseq
blog](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/rnaseq) with cutting-edge information.

Best to all.
