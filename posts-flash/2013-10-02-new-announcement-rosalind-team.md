Here is Rosalind team's latest update:
<!--more-->

> It's hard to believe how far we've come in the year since we first released
Rosalind. We know that we couldn't have made it this far without you, our
dedicated users. You may have wondered why you haven't heard much from us
recently. The reason is that we have been working on a fun new educational
website called Stepic (<https://beta.stepic.org>), a resource for fully
interactive learning.

We would love it if you would help us during our public beta. Today, we have
posted Chapter

1 of Bioinformatics Algorithms, a new interactive textbook that will be used
in the first bioinformatics algorithms MOOC on Coursera. By the way, this
class will be starting on October 21, so please sign up soon!

We continue to be amazed at what Pavel Pevzner is up to. The man clearly has
the right vision on using internet-based methods to teach bioinformatics and
is executing on it superbly. Ruibang forwarded [this link in
twitter](https://www.coursera.org/course/bioinformatics), which covers his
bioinformatics course at Coursera.

The course will be in its first session in a few days, but Nikolay Vyahhi, one
of the instructors (and author of rectangular graph paper), informed us a few
months back about preparing for it.
