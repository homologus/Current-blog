Dear readers,

In mid-February, I made a somewhat finished draft of the book available for
purchase [here](https://leanpub.com/NGS-assembly/), but did not announce in
the blog, because I was not happy with the quality. Since then, I have been
working on improving a number of sections. Over the next few days, I will post
the texts of those sections as separate blog commentaries and then publish an
updated version of the book around April 15th by incorporating all those
sections. I am quite satisfied with the changes and expect the finalized book
to be useful for newcomers.

I am planning to set the price at $20 after the next release, but if you grab
the book now at the leanpub site, you will be able to get it for $15. As I
mentioned earlier, once you make the initial purchase from leanpub, you will
always be able to access the latest version from their site at no extra cost.
They give pdf, mobi and epub formats.

If you like to see a copy of the released version, please feel free to email
me at samanta@homolog.us and I will send you a pdf file.
