We previously covered work from David Tse's group ([Optimal Assembly for High
Throughput Shotgun Sequencing](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/blog/2013/01/05
/optimal-assembly-for-high-throughput-shotgun-sequencing/)) and a number of
his other papers [are available from arxiv](http://arxiv.org/find/all/1/all:+A
ND+Tse+assembly/0/1/0/all/0/1?skip=0&query_id=873b9d2364d395e5).

They are math-intensive, but above tutorial slides (click on image to access)
forwarded by reader Asif present them in simple language. Here is Asif's note
-

> This is a set of tutorial slides presented at the International Symposium on
Information Theory a few months ago. They summarize the work from David Tse's
group, including the papers linked below. The papers are somewhat technical,
and problem is also complex. So the slides are helpful to highlight the main
results and the approach taken without the burden of being as precise as the
submissions to arxiv.org, but with a faithful representation of the ideas.
