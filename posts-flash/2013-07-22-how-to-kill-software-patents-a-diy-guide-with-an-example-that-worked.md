We often complained about software patents, but Joel Spolsky, the co-founder
and CEO of stackexchange, did something lot more useful. He created a
stackexchange forum for USPTO and allow crowd-sourcing to work to kill bad
software patents. The blog post [Victory Lap for Ask
Patents](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2013/07/22.html) by Joel Spolsky
presents an example of using crowd-sourcing to kill a stupid software patent
from Microsoft !!

block a patent application, theyll use Ask Patents to start messing with their
competitors. How cool would it be if Apple, Samsung, Oracle and Google got
into a Mexican Standoff on Ask Patents? If each of those companies had three
or four engineers dedicating a few hours every day to picking off their
competitors applications, the number of granted patents to those companies
would grind to a halt. Wouldnt that be something!

We surely hope his dream comes true.
