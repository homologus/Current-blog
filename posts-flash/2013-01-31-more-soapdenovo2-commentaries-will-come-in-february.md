We are redesigning parts of the website. Please do not get surprised, if the
theme looks different.

Dear Readers,

We are at the end of January and were not able to keep up with [promised
commentaries on SOAPdenovo2](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/2013/01/01/january-
is-our-learn-how-soapdenovo2-works-month/). Privately we are continuing to
play with the code, but did not get time to describe the pieces together in
coherent articles. Those commentaries will continue to appear in February.

Here is our bigger objective. We plan to split [all major
assemblers](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/2013/01/25/notes-on-assemblathon-
paper/) into code components and mix and match them to assemble the [fish
library in Assemblathon
2](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/2013/01/23/assemblathon-2-paper-is-available-
at-arxiv/), which was the hardest to assemble. We like to understand the
results of Assemblathon 2 at the algorithmic level, and explain to our
readers.

Our next SOAPdenovo2-related commentary describing the data structures will
come next. Also note that Rayan Chikhi has been working on the scaffolding
part of the code and updated [SOAPdenovo2 wiki page with top-level description
of how scaffolding runs](http://homolog.us/wiki1/index.php?title=SOAPdenovo2#S
tep_4._.28Scaffolding.29).
