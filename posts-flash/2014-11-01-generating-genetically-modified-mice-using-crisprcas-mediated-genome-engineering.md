> Mice with specific gene modifications are valuable tools for studying
development and disease. Traditional gene targeting in mice using embryonic
stem (ES) cells, although suitable for generating sophisticated genetic
modifications in endogenous genes, is complex and time-consuming. We have
recently described CRISPR/Cas-mediated genome engineering for the generation
of mice carrying mutations in multiple genes, endogenous reporters,
conditional alleles or defined deletions. Here we provide a detailed protocol
for embryo manipulation by piezo-driven injection of nucleic acids into the
cytoplasm to create gene-modified mice. Beginning with target design, the
generation of gene-modified mice can be achieved in as little as 4 weeks. We
also describe the application of the CRISPR/Cas technology for the
simultaneous editing of multiple genes (five genes or more) after a single
transfection of ES cells. The principles described in this protocol have
already been applied in rats and primates, and they are applicable to
sophisticated genome engineering in species in which ES cells are not
available.
