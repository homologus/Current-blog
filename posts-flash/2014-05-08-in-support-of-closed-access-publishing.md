There is no shortage of supporters of open-access publishing, who usually
highlight Nature and Science as their evil enemies.

All of our commentaries related to publishing had been along the same line,
and we were very receptive about a number of newly founded open-access
journals. However, today we were looking for information on open access and
came across the following comment from [Rebecca
Rooney](http://www.researchgate.net/post

suggestions_for_early_career_professionals) \-

> I used to be an advocate of "Open Access" publishing. But in my new position
as faculty, I'm changing my mind.

Open Access publishing can be very expensive. I recently opted to make a paper
"Open Access" at a cost of $3000. In retrospect, I don't know that it was a
wise use of funds. For the same cost I could have hired a co-op student for a
term or sent a graduate student to an international conference. Given how hard
we work to raise research dollars as new faculty, I am starting to resent all
the pressure to spend thousands extra on each publication. Especially when you
consider that most copyright agreements allow researchers to archive a pre-
print or even post-print version on their websites.

Plus, if any person is curious to see an article I've written, all they need
to do is e-mail me requesting a copy for research purposes. I am then entitled
to share it with them, and generally respond within 24 hrs. Having another
scientist contact me directly to request a paper I've written is a lovely
experience. It connects us and could lead to all manner of fruitful
collaborations. When we pay publishers to make our papers free on the
internet, that incentive to reach out and directly contact other researchers
in our discipline disappears. Maybe with "Open Access" we actually wind up
more isolated?

After reading it, we remembered that one of our readers (S. Malhotra)
previously made a comment along similar line in "[New Bioinformatics Business
Model Make Software Free, Charge for
Manual](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/blog/2014/01/31/new-bioinformatics-
business-model-make-software-free-charge-manual/#comment-126138)".

> Have you tried contacting the authors by email for a free copy of the
manuscript? Most authors are more than happy to oblige such requests.

Its not always possible to provide open-access articles. The authors must pay
the journal to do this, and not everyone has money to do this. Even if they
do, some universities do not allow funds to be used for open-access. Posting a
pdf on the website often violates the publishers copyrights. Posting on arXiv
has other drawbacks as well.

Thus I dont think the researchers get pleasure in locking up their papers. Its
just not always possible to make the article open access, and most authors
would be happy to share their article by email.

I do not think it is fair to write a post to call out authors for not making
their article open-access. Open access is highly desirable, I agree, but it is
not always possible.

Our usual response is to show how much the educational organizations and
funding agencies are losing with closed access and so on (the points typically
made by Mike Eisen or [PeerJ
here](http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/peerjs-99-open-access-model-
one-year-on/2011960.article)), but those arguments are not very helpful for an
ordinary researcher trying to properly allocate her small research budget.

What will you tell Rebecca Rooney or S. Malhotra to counter - "In retrospect,
I don't know that it was a wise use of funds. For the same cost I could have
hired a co-op student for a term or sent a graduate student to an
international conference."? Is closed-access publication + exposure of student
at an international conference better than paying extra for open access?

Edit.

> We have just enabled Lens-viewing of open access articles on PubChase, in
collaboration with Ivan Grubisic1. Lens is an extraordinary step forward in
visualization of research. Not only is it infinitely superior to PDFs, but it
is even better than reading manuscript printouts. Figures are next to the text
and you no longer need to hop around the articles between the text and
references, constantly losing your place2. Alas, there is a wrinkle. We had
hoped to Lensify all Pubmed Central free content, but turns out that we cannot
because only a fraction of PMC content is truly open access; free to read does
not mean open access.

The PMC content that we can legally display in the Lens format on PubChase is
that which is under the Creative Commons Licenses. Most of these papers are
from the PLOS, BiomedCentral, and Hindawii publishers. Unfortunately, almost
90% of PMC articles are free to read as PDFs, but are under restrictive
publisher copyrights that make it illegal for PubChase to reformat them. Even
author-submitted manuscripts in compliance with the NIH Public Access Policy
are subject to the publisher copyright and we cannot display them.

This shocked me. While there has recently been much buzz about scams by new OA
journals, especially with the Science Sting by Bohannon, the biggest scam is
the one by subscription journals. Many erroneously assume that only open
access journals charge a fee for publication, while subscription journals only
charge for access. Far from it. My recent paper in PNAS cost $3,500 to publish
with the following fees (excerpt from PNAS acceptance e-mail):
