title: I Want to Try a Publishing Experiment

Four years back, I made a discovery that I believe was my best work in science
so far. However, it was based on an oddball idea and I was not enamored by the
efforts of trying to convince DW editors of regular journals about its merits.

I would like to solely use the [ncRNA section of our
blog](http://homolog.us/ncRNA/) and [arxiv.org](http://arxiv.org/) to
'publish' it. No part of it will ever be sent to a traditional journal. I am
interested to see, how this oddball way of publishing works with my oddball
idea !!

Once again, I am not making a hyperbole in saying that it is my best work in
science so far. I truly believe in what I said. 'Best' means I perceive this
work to be better than anything else I did previously in my long academic
career. To compare, I was a participant of [Indian Maths Olympiad team in
Braunschweig](http://www.imo-official.org/year_info.aspx?year=1989). Then I
joined the Electronics department of Indian Institute of Technology, foremost
engineering college in India, and left with the highest rank in my class. I
got bored with engineering by the time I reached post-graduate program at
Purdue. So, I learned quantum mechanics on my own and [published a paper in
Physical Review,](http://prb.aps.org/abstract/PRB/v53/i12/pR7626_1) the best
physics journal, and my paper received over [450 citations so far](http://scho
lar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&q=samanta+datta+electronic+conduction+organic+mol
ecules&btnG=Search&as_sdt=0%2C48&as_ylo=&as_vis=0). I started working on
biology in 2001 (again learned on my own without attending a single class) and
published many papers in
[Science](http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/sci;314/5801/960), [
Nature](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v465/n7298/abs/nature09016.html),
[PNAS](http://www.pnas.org/content/100/22/12579.short) and other journals. I
even predicted the financial crisis in 2005 in these two articles
([here](http://www.safehaven.com/article/2423/the-flation-debate) and
[here](http://www.safehaven.com/article/2478/nonlinearity-memory-effect-and-
the-markets)). Those two articles are worth reading, because the real crisis
predicted there has not happened yet.

Getting back to our original discussion, I believe the results I will post are
bigger discoveries than all of the above. So, in the traditional sense of bio
community I will be 'giving them away', while I could get a real publication
added to my bio.

Here is the game plan. I will be using this blog to discuss algorithms on
next-gen sequencing and use [the ncRNA section](http://www.homolog.us/ncRNA)
to disclose this oddball discovery in steps. When I post something there, I
will also give you a heads-up here. That way, most of you, who come here to
learn about next-gen techniques will be able to focus on NGS.

Please let me know from time to time, what you think.
