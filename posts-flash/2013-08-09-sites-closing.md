My Fellow Users,

I have been forced to make a difficult decision: to become complicit in crimes
against the American people or walk away from nearly ten years of hard work by
shutting down Lavabit. After significant soul searching, I have decided to
suspend operations. I wish that I could legally share with you the events that
led to my decision. I cannot. I feel you deserve to know whats going on--the
first amendment is supposed to guarantee me the freedom to speak out in
situations like this. Unfortunately, Congress has passed laws that say
otherwise. As things currently stand, I cannot share my experiences over the
last six weeks, even though I have twice made the appropriate requests.

Whats going to happen now? Weve already started preparing the paperwork needed
to continue to fight for the Constitution in the Fourth Circuit Court of
Appeals. A favorable decision would allow me resurrect Lavabit as an American
company.

This experience has taught me one very important lesson: without congressional
action or a strong judicial precedent, I would _strongly_ recommend against
anyone trusting their private data to a company with physical ties to the
United States.

Sincerely,

Ladar Levison

Owner and Operator, Lavabit LLC
