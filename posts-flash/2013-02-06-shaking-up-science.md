We will leave it to you to judge other points mentioned in the article, but to
us, the trouble goes far beyond closed publication, winner-take-all prizes and
gender ratio. The following quote seemed most suitable -

> Scientists love to think that they are totally objective, when in fact
theyre often not, Bennett says. I think its very important to

look at these questions.

Let us mention one striking observation we made based on interacting with
hundreds of US 'scientists' over the last six years. So far, we came across
exactly o[ne professional scientist](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/2012/12/26
/review-of-2012-thought-provoking-commentary-from-a-professor-of-chemistry-at-
cornell/comment-page-1/), who could properly explain the banking and financial
crisis to us. That says a lot about a group of people, who claim to earn their
living by thinking.
