> The synthesis and functionalization of amines are fundamentally important in
a vast range of chemical contexts. We present an amine synthesis that
repurposes two simple feedstock building blocks: olefins and
nitro(hetero)arenes. Using readily available reactants in an operationally
simple procedure, the protocol smoothly yields secondary amines in a formal
olefin hydroamination. Because of the presumed radical nature of the process,
hindered amines can easily be accessed in a highly chemoselective
transformation. A screen of more than 100 substrate combinations showcases
tolerance of numerous unprotected functional groups such as alcohols, amines,
and even boronic acids. This process is orthogonal to other aryl amine
syntheses, such as the Buchwald-Hartwig, Ullmann, and classical amine-carbonyl
reductive aminations, as it tolerates aryl halides and carbonyl compounds.
