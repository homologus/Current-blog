Dear readers,
<!--more-->

Two of our papers got accepted or nearly accepted by academic journals. One is
on the 'bootstrapped genome project' described over a year back. Despite my
best efforts, the biologists were reluctant to allow me to post a preprint on
the arxiv :(. The other one is on psychological analysis of some negative
aspects of society. I need to be cryptic until it comes out.

We were busy working on revisions, etc. and could not post any update here for
the last two weeks. Posting will be more frequent from now on.
