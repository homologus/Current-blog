title: Is the 'Readers' Comment' Button at HUGO Journal for Show Only?

The garbage paper ["The extent of functionality in the human
genome"](http://www.thehugojournal.com/content/7/1/2) is the highest access at
HUGO journal. It is supposed to be a rebuttal of Dan Graur's exposure of
ENCODE. John S Mattick, the first author, is an 'ENCODE leader'.

One curious feature of HUGO journal is a "Readers' comments" link. Strangely,
no reader left a comment on this highly controversial topic.

That is rather odd, because if the highest accessed paper of the journal never
gets a comment, maybe the readers are completely apathetic toward what gets
published in the journal. Why should anyone bother to publish anything there?

As it appears, readers are not really apathetic, but the journal editors are
working hard to keep their comments away. On August 1st, Dr. Martin Hafner of
Institute for Genetics at University of Cologne made the heroic attempt of
trying to leave a short (and rather uncontroversial) criticism of Mattick's
paper, but his comment never made to the website. We publish it below with
minor spelling corrections.

**Larry Moran's critique**

Comment:

Readers may be interested in Larry Moran's critique at his Sandwalk blog

(http://sandwalk.blogspot.de/2013/08/the-junk-dna-controversy-john-
mattick.html). IMO T. Ryan Gregory's onion test cited by Mattick is not so
much about the fact that onion genomes are bigger than the human genome but
rather about the fact that the sizes of the smallest and the biggest onion
genomes differ by a factor of 5. One would have to claim different
complexities for these onion species if one believes that most sequences are
functional.

Will Pubmed Commons fix this problem of arbitrary comment screening? We will
discuss that in a forthcoming commentary.
