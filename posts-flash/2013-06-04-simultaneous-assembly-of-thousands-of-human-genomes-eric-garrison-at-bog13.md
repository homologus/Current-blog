Readers will enjoy the following slides from Erik Garrison's talk at Biology
of Genome conference. He is trying to get video of his talk, and when it
comes, we will link to the video as well.

Erik is doing his excellent work as a researcher (staff

scientist) at [Gabor Marth's lab at Boston
College](http://bioinformatics.bc.edu/marthlab/wiki/index.php/Erik_Garrison).
You can access freebayes and other codes from his github page
[here](https://github.com/ekg). Gabor Marth is well known for his early work
on SNP discovery in the last century and Erik's 'freebayes' is name likely
came from 'polybayes' algorithm mentioned in the following paper.

[A general approach to single-nucleotide polymorphism
discovery.](http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v23/n4/full/ng1299_452.html)
Gabor T. Marth, Mark D. Yandell, Ian Korf, Zhijie Gu, Raymond T. Yeh, Hamideh
Zakeri, Nathan O. Stitziel, LaDeana Hillier, Pui-Yan Kwok and Warren Gish.
Nature Genetics 23, 452-456 (1999).

Unfortunately, the Nature Genetics paper itself is not free after 14 $%#$%#
years!! [These
slides](http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~brudno/csc2431w10/polybayes_pres.pdf) may
be helpful, if you are interested in learning the algorithm. We will check to
see whether Erik has plan to write a 'freepaper' algorithm to let others see
Marth's original manuscript :)

P. S. Erik responded with sending a link to his freebayes paper, thankfully
deposited at arxiv.

Sequencing](http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.3907)
