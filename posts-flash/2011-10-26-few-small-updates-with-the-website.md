**lincRNA blog**
<!--more-->

At the top of the page, you will see a new box -

![](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Capture1.png)

Here you will find a new blog with discussions on lincRNAs. We have been
interested in this topic ever since those weird RNAs started to show up [in
our tiling array
screens](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/306/5705/2242.short). We had hard
time convincing any serious biologist that they were real. 'Junk expression'
was a term we have been used to hearing.

The updates in lincRNA blog will not be as frequent as this blog. When we post
something new, we shall mention here as well as in twitter. Twitter updates
will be marked with 'lincRNA' tag so that readers primarily interested in NGS
algorithms do not need to bother.

We start with a new post - _[HOTAIR a cancer
lincRNA_](http://homolog.us/ncRNA/?p=1).
