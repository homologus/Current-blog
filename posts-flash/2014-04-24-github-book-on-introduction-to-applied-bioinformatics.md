> Bioinformatics, as I see it, is the application of the tools of computer
science (things like programming languages, algorithms, and databases) to
address biological problems (for example, inferring the evolutionary
relationship between a group of organisms based on fragments of their genomes,
or understanding if or how the community of microorganisms that live in my gut
changes if I modify my diet). Bioinformatics is a rapidly growing field,
largely in response to the vast increase in the quantity of data that
biologists now grapple with. Students from varied disciplines (e.g., biology,
computer science, statistics, and biochemistry) and stages of their
educational careers (undergraduate, graduate, or postdoctoral) are becoming
interested in bioinformatics.

I teach bioinformatics at the undergraduate and graduate levels at Northern
Arizona University. This repository contains some of the materials that I've
developed in these courses, and represents an initial attempt to organize
these materials in a standalone way. In some cases, I'm just linking out to
other materials for now.
