Dear readers,
<!--more-->

Please say good bye to our socio-economic commentaries, because nobody seems
to like them. From now on, we will be discussing codes and algorithms 48 hours
a day.

Commentaries on following topics will leave us -

i) Most discussions on open-access publication and journal policies. The 'war'
is over.

ii) Socio-economic trends and forecasts. You know them already and there is no
point repeating the same thing.

iii) Topics on contemporary finance - student loans, credit default swaps,
banking system, European economy, etc. Give everyone a trillion dollar
platinum coin.

iv) General discussions on NIH budget, elections, democracy, war on
<del>Islam</del> terror, etc. Who cares?

v) Discussions on Vioxx and other bad drugs. Check (iv)

\------------------------------

P. S. On popular request, we decided to keep those posts, but move them to a
new blog focused on socio-politico-economic trends. The location of the blog
is [here](http://homolog.us/Social/) (fixed the link).
