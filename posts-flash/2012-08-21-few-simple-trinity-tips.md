After over 24 hours of [Trinity](http://trinityrnaseq.sourceforge.net/) run on
a huge RNAseq library, we were greeted with this message -

It is actually not what you are thinking. We were initially fooled by the
message and thought the program ran out of RAM. Actually the program crashed,
because Trinity shell commands use absolute paths instead of relative paths
during its operation. While Trinity was at its 15th hour of running Meryl, we
happened to move the topmost folder to make sure the large files do not crowd
out backup system. That little effort to speed up the execution delayed it by
hours. When Meryl completed, Inchworm started and immediately crashed, because
it could not find any file.

What is the best way to run Trinity by skipping Meryl or Inchworm (because
they already completed), or run it step by step? Trinity command line does not
give us any option, and we are too intellectually challenged to go through the
manuals or code. We found an easy way by running Trinity on a short library
and capturing the screen output in a file. Screen output generated by Trinity
is very detailed, and prints complete commands with all parameters for
Inchworm, Chrysalis and Butterfly steps.

The above suggestion may come handy, if you like to run your own k-mer
counting code before using Trinity for the remaining steps. You will have to
print the output in meryl format, and then tell Inchworm and other steps that
you used meryl.
