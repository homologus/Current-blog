During the last two years, we posted nearly 400 bioinformatics-related
commentaries. This has the effect of us not being able to quickly find old
topics we are looking for, and we are sure you are equally lost. Google was of
no help for older posts. Blog format values recency over long-term value, and
Google's search engines also gives more weight to recency. We tried playing
with tags, tag clouds and categories to tidy things up a bit, but had to give
up.

Being frustrated, we decided to build a tutorial section to repost some
introductory topics. That way, it will be easy to read the discussions
sequentially like a book. The existing blog posts will stay where they are and
will not be removed.

We will start by creating tutorials on de Bruijn graphs and search algorithms,
and will then set up other assembly-related topics. If there is enough
interest, we can host Chinese translation of the same topics separately. What
is a good translator?

The final stage of a genome project and setting up tutorials kept us busy, and
we could not spend much time on figuring out SOAPdenovo and other assemblers.
We will get back to that work after sending out the genome paper.
