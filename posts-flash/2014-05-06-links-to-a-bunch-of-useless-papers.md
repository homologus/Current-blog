1\. [Heisenberg
1925](http://people.isy.liu.se/jalar/kurser/QF/references/Heisenberg1925.pdf)
<!--more-->

In this paper, Heisenberg wrote the mathematical rules to connect classical
mechanics with quantum observations. If you like to track modern quantum
mechanics to its read, this is the paper to read. The only problem is that it
is not very easy to read paper, but you may seek help from this 2004 paper in
arxiv - [Understanding Heisenbergs magical paper of July 1925: a new look at
the calculational details](http://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0404009v1.pdf).

2\. [Dirac 1925 - The Fundamental Equations of Quantum
Mechanics](http://www.astro.puc.cl/~rparra/tools/PAPERS/dirac_1925.pdf)

Dirac tidied up Heisenberg's paper mentioned in 1.

3\. [Quantum Mechanics and a Preliminary Investigation of the Hydrogen Atom](h
ttp://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/110/755/561.full.pdf+html)

Using newly discovered mathematical machinery (1 & 2), Dirac explored the
hydrogen atom.

4\. [On the Theory of Quantum
Mechanics](http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/112/762/661)

Schrodinger enters the picture in this paper.

5\. [The Physical Interpretation of the Quantum Dynamics](http://rspa.royalsoc
ietypublishing.org/content/113/765/621.full.pdf+html)

Dirac is fascinated about how extensible the new mathematical techniques are.

6\. [The Quantum Theory of the Emission and Absorption of
Radiation](http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/114/767/243)

This paper marks the birth of quantum electrodynamics. The topic eventually
evolved into a vast field with contributions from Feynman, Tomonaga and
Schwinger.

The cleaned, refined and extended version of Dirac's mathematics came to be
known as [second
Quantization](http://yclept.ucdavis.edu/course/242/2Q_Fradkin.pdf) and is
useful to derive the collective state of many quantum particles acting
together. It is one of the less explored areas of physics, despite many
decades of research.

7\. [The Quantum Theory of the Electron - Dirac 1928](http://rspa.royalsociety
publishing.org/content/117/778/610.full.pdf+html)

The subject says it all.

The above paper cites a [physicist
Darwin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Galton_Darwin), who happened to
be the grandson of biologist Darwin.

> Darwin was born in Cambridge, England into a scientific dynasty, the son of
the mathematician Sir George Howard Darwin and the grandson of Charles Darwin.
His mother was Lady Darwin, Maud du Puy of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His
elder sister was the artist Gwen Raverat, and his younger sister Margaret
married Geoffrey Keynes, the brother of the economist John Maynard Keynes. His
younger brother William Robert Darwin was a London stockbroker. Darwin was
educated at Marlborough College and, in 1910, he graduated from Trinity
College, Cambridge in mathematics.

\----------------------------------------------------

Getting back to #6, why is the topic less explored? The answer lies in
mathematics not being able to catch up with physics. When quantum mechanics
was born, mathematics was a very advanced field due to three centuries of work
from Newton, Euler, Lagrange, Gauss, Riemann, Fourier, Hamilton and all the
way up to Hilbert, who was present at that time. Physicists drove on all
cylinders and exhausted every mathematical tool including Hamilton's
quaternions. However, they apparently reached the limits of mathematical
developments and could not handle infinite number of particles with the
available methods. Since 1950s, every discovery on new ground state from the
many body Hamiltonian appeared to have introduced new mathematical method as
well. However, the approach does not allow a general solution.

We believe there is room for many centuries of new discoveries in this area.
This will most likely take place in emerging Asia.
