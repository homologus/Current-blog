Constructing suffix arrays in external memory is very useful, and we covered
the topic in various blog posts (see
[here](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/blog/2013/01/21/lightweight-bwt-
construction-for-very-large-string-collections/),
[here](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/blog/2013/01/28/on-constructing-suffix-
arrays-and-lcp-arrays-in-external-memory/) and
[here](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/blog/2013/02/21/construction-of-suffix-
array-in-external-memory-follow-up/),
[here](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/blog/2013/05/14/external-memory-
generalized-suffix-and-lcp-arrays-construction/)). Also, there is BEETL and
RopeBWT for constructing BWT of very large read libraries in external memory.

[Felipe Louza](http://www.ic.unicamp.br/~ra144643/), a Brazilian researcher
working in the field and a frequent commenter in previous blog posts, has a
new update that our readers will find informative.

> I have commited in GitHub a new version of a tool to construct generalized

enhanced suffix arrays.

The only related work (in mode 2) I know is <https://github.com/BEETL/BEETL>,

but they are limit to indexing strings of the same length.

Enjoy !
