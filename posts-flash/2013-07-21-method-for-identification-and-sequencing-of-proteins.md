> Abstract: Protein samples are processed to create a mixture of modified and
unmodified or overlapping peptides which are analyzed using mass spectrometry.
Correlations between the MS/MS spectra of peptide pairs allow the noise in
individual MS/MS spectra to be greatly reduced. A small number of peptide
reconstructions can be generated that are likely to contain the correct one.
This allows for the de novo reconstruction of protein sequences and peptide
and modification identification through a database search using extremely fast
pattern matching, rather than time-consuming matching of spectra against
database...
