We started with 600 million 100mer reads from a genomic library and plotted
its K-mer distribution. It looked like the following plot.

The peak around 52 suggests that non-repetitive regions of the genome are
covered ~52 times by the reads. For details about the basic philosophy of what
is being plotted and why, please read our earlier commentary on [Maximizing
Utility of Available RAMs in K-mer
World](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/2011/09/20/maximizing-utility-of-available-
rams-in-k-mer-world/).

When we added another 800 million 51mer reads into the pot, the K-mer
distribution changed to the following image. The peak of two combined
libraries moved to 58.

Does that make sense? The new library has about 70% as many sequences as the
old one. Shouldn't the peak shift from 52 to 88?

Stay tuned for an explanation.
