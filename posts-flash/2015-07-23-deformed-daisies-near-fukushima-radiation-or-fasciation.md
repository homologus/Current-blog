They are deformed daisies near Fukushima, but is the deformation caused by
radiation? [Fasciation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasciation) is the
alternate explanation.

> Fasciation (or cresting) is a relatively rare condition of abnormal growth
in vascular plants in which the apical meristem (growing tip), which normally
is concentrated around a single point and produces approximately cylindrical
tissue, instead becomes elongated perpendicularly to the direction of growth,
thus, producing flattened, ribbon-like, crested, or elaborately contorted
tissue.[1] Fasciation may also cause plant parts to increase in weight and
volume in some instances.[2] The phenomenon may occur in the stem, root,
fruit, or flower head. Some plants are grown and prized aesthetically for
their development of fasciation.[3] Any occurrence of fasciation has several
possible causes, including hormonal, genetic, bacterial, fungal, viral and
environmental causes.

The answer is not either/or, because fasciation can also be caused by genetic
mutation from radiation. Speaking of radiation, readers may also find the
