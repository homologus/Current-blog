title: Question for the Readers - What is the Convention for Submission of Raw Reads
  these Days?

Couple of days back, we [talked about a RNAseq
paper](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/2012/07/11/two-rnaseq-papers-worm-and-sea-
urchin/) on sea urchin that came out in the advanced publication section of
Genome Research. The paper seemed to have two shortcomings, as we mentioned in
the earlier commentary. Among them, the question of long non-coding RNA really
interests us, given the unique position of sea urchin in the evolutionary
tree.

The Genome Research paper did not provide any link for submission of raw
reads. When we asked one of the authors, he mentioned that there was no
requirement for submitting raw reads to SRA or GEO these days, and the sea
urchin group does not plan to release them soon.

Is that the convention for large scale experiments these days? For all of our
papers, the editors pestered us endlessly until we made full submission of all
large-scale data to GEO or SRA.
