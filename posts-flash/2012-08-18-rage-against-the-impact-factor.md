In our previous commentary ("[Study Shows Men are Better than Women in
Bioinformatics (p<0.05)](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/2012/08/18/study-shows-
men-are-better-than-women-in-bioinformatics-p/)"), we showed how statistics
can be misused to reach any fanciful conclusion, and so-called 'studies' hyped
up by media need to be taken with a grain of salt. Overuse of journal impact
factor to measure individual performance or make grant decision is another
example of good measure gone bad, as two articles point out.

Personally, we do not think all creative uses of impact factor have been
exhausted. We are seeking data and help to compute impact factors of all
coffee shops, McDonalds and Walmarts in the country based on how often they
are visited by 'high impact factor researchers'. We envision a world, where
all products and services will be marked with tagged with their impact
factors.

Big Mac - IF - 3.07, Price $4.99

Fries - IF - 7.01, Price $1.99

Coffee - IF - 7.21, Price $1.01

Genome Biology - IF - 9.04, Priceless
