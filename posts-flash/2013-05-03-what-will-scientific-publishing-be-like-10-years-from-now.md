scientific publishing.

[Open-access Scientific Publishing is Gaining
Ground](http://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21577035-open-
access-scientific-publishing-gaining-ground-free-all)

We will highlight the major points in following paragraph before speculating
on what comes next.

Market sizes:

>

* Elsevier, a Dutch firm that is the worlds biggest journal publisher, had a margin last year of 38% on revenues of 2.1 billion ($3.2 billion). 

* Springer, a German firm that is the second-biggest journal publisher, made 36% on sales of 875m ($1.1 billion) in 2011 (the most recent year for which figures are available).

* Outsell, a Californian consultancy, estimates that open-access journals generated $172m in 2012. That was just 2.8% of the total revenue journals brought their publishers (some $6 billion a year), but it was up by 34% from 2011 and is expected to reach $336m in 2015. 

Who are the open-source leaders?

Meet your new boss. It is the same as old boss :)

>

* The biggest is BioMed Central, part of Springer. It was founded in 2000 and in February it published its 150,000th paper and also launched its 250th periodical. 

* Days later Nature Publishing Group (NPG), which owns Nature and 81 other journals, and which itself belongs to the Georg von Holtzbrinck Publishing Group, another German firm, took control of Frontiers, a Swiss open-access platform with 30 titles in 14 scientific fields. That will take NPGs tally of open-access journals to 46, and increase the number of free papers it publishes each year by 5,000, to 7,300.

* In the past year Elsevier has more than doubled the number of open-access journals it publishes, to 39. 

* And even in those that usually charge readers (such as Cell and the Lancet), paying a publication fee makes a paper available free immediately.

How much does it cost to run an electronic journal?

>

* ArXiv is hosted by Cornell University at a cost of $830,000 a year.

Who are the new guys? Frontiers, PLoS, PeerJ.

What are old guards doing to fight back? They are creating own open-source
journals with no publication fee - eLife, Episciences (piggyback on ArXiv).

\---------------------------------------------------------

Up to above paragraph are written based on the Economist article. Let us
speculate on what comes next.

**10 years later**

Suppose the academic journals did not exist and young scientists of today
wanted to build an infrastructure to communicate effectively. Will they create
the expensive journals, work for them for free and then get their articles
locked up? That does not make sense at all. We expect the publication model of
ten years later to be completely distributed and it will use all benefits of
'online publication' rather than recreating paper publication as web text.
Also, we expect search engines and social communities to be the primary
sources useful information. A newly uploaded arxiv paper explores those
aspects regarding twitter.

[The Role of Twitter in the Life Cycle of a Scientific
Publication](http://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1305/1305.0435.pdf)

> Twitter is a micro-blogging social media platform for short messages that
can have a long-term impact on how scientists create and publish ideas. We
investigate the usefulness of twitter in the development and distribution of
scientific knowledge. At the start of the 'life cycle' of a scientific
publication, twitter provides a large virtual department of colleagues that
can help to rapidly generate, share and refine new ideas. As ideas become
manuscripts, twitter can be used as an informal arena for the pre-review of
works in progress. Finally, tweeting published findings can communicate
research to a broad audience of other researchers, decision makers,
journalists and the general public that can amplify the scientific and social
impact of publications. However, there are limitations, largely surrounding
issues of intellectual property and ownership, inclusiveness and
misrepresentations of science sound bites. Nevertheless, we believe twitter is
a useful social media tool that can provide a valuable contribution to
scientific publishing in the 21st century.

All those technological changes are generally expected. The following part is
what nobody in publishing industry expects at all. Add a second condition -
'no government funding' to our previous description and you will see why even
models like PLoS are heading for extinction. In such situation, it is expected
that academics/scholars will earn money from their publications rather than
paying someone to get their research published. The change will come very
fast. Do not get fooled by the apparent slow pace of change of present, and
take a hint from Ernest Hemingway's quote -

>

How did you go bankrupt?" Two ways. Gradually, then suddenly.

It is not only the publishing industry is broken, but the entire panoply of
academic tenure, student debt, government-funded research that is broken. In
fact, the college industry is the most broken of all among various US sectors,
and the following chart is the best guide.

If you think 'STEM' is more productive, it is another government-funded
vacuous buzzword [with no real economic
backing](http://charleshughsmith.blogspot.com/2013/05/college-grads-its-
different-economy.html).

> Getting a college degree, even in the STEM (science, technology, engineering
and math) subjects, no longer guarantees a job. As I have often noted,
producing more graduates does not magically create jobs. The economy can only
support a certain number of jobs in any one field. Producing 10 times as many
graduates in that field does not create 10 times more jobs.

According to this analysis of supply, employment, and wage trends in
information technology (IT) and other high-tech fields, [Guestworkers in the
high-skill U.S. labor market](http://www.epi.org/publication/bp359
-guestworkers-high-skill-labor-market-analysis/) (via B.C.), only half of
those graduating with STEM degrees get jobs in STEM fields.

Interestingly, 36% of IT workers do not hold a college degree, and only 24% of
IT workers have a four-year college degree. As one would expect in a nation
with a strong tradition of immigration, many guest workers (i.e. people
seeking citizenship via working in the U.S.) also have degrees in the STEM
fields.

This report [Where are the STEM
jobs?](http://www.stemconnector.org/sites/default/files/store/STEM-Students-
STEM-Jobs-Executive-Summary.pdf) (via B.C.) predicts 8.65 million STEM jobs in
the U.S. by 2018, which is a mere 6% of the current workforce of 142 million.

The best way to see the future is to expect rapid drop in all kinds of
government backing from the economy and figure out how the publication system
will adjust. That rapid drop can happen over two years of 2015-2017, or two
years of 2020-2022 or any other period. We do not know when the adjustment
will take place except that we are sure the government support will go away
all of a sudden and real economy of academic publishing will show up. Our
original assumption - "Suppose the academic journals did not exist and young
scientists of today wanted to build an infrastructure to communicate
effectively" - will show up differently. The academic journals will become so
expensive due to other social changes that they will non-existent for most
practical purposes.

For the time being there is no perceived danger as the stock price of Elsevier
is at all time high -
