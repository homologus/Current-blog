"You are the first person I sat next to in a flight, who reads PacBio papers.
Are those instruments still around?" Asked the gentleman sitting beside me in
the flight to Phoenix.

The experience was something unique to me as well. During my flying career
spanning several decades, I got to sit with all kinds of people, including
cops, grandmas without teeth, football players, dentists, ex-soldiers playing
shooting video-games, grandmas with false teeth, families carrying screaming
babies, screaming kids carrying parents, several flavors of overweight persons
occupying half of my seat, but never two groups - (i) good-looking women, (ii)
practicing bioinformaticians.

The gentleman explained that he worked on cancer at the Translational Genomics
Research Institute in Phoenix. He was on his way back from Seattle after
attending the GO meeting and another cancer-related conference.

Whoever he is, we are dedicating [our new PacBio
tutorials](http://www.homolog.us/Tutorials/index.php?p=1.1&s=5) to him. Few
sections, such as the ones on HGAP and Quiver, will be completed soon.
