> It is proposed that the precellular stage of biological evolution unraveled
within networks of inorganic compartments that harbored a diverse mix of
virus-like genetic elements. This stage of evolution might makes up the Last
Universal Cellular Ancestor (LUCA) that more appropriately could be denoted
Last Universal Cellular Ancestral State (LUCAS). Such a scenario recapitulates
the ideas of J. B. S. Haldane sketched in his classic 1928 essay. However,
unlike in Haldane's day, considerable support for this scenario exits today:
lack of homology between core DNA replication system components in archaea and
bacteria, distinct membrane chemistries and enzymes of lipid biosynthesis in
archaea and bacteria, spread of several viral hallmark genes among diverse
groups of viruses, and the extant archaeal and bacterial chromosomes appear to
be shaped by accretion of diverse, smaller replicons. Under the viral model of
precellular evolution, the key components of cells originated as components of
virus-like entities. The two surviving types of cellular life forms, archaea
and bacteria, might have emerged from the LUCAS independently, along with,
probably, numerous forms now extinct.
