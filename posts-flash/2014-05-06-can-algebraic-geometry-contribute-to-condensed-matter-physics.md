Algebraic geometry is the branch of mathematics that used to study the roots
of polynomial equations and thus connected geometry and algebra. With
classical algebra turning into abstract algebra in the last century, the field
of algebraic geometry [took a new
turn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_geometry).

>

Modern algebraic geometry is based on more abstract techniques of abstract
algebra, especially commutative algebra, with the language and the problems of
geometry.

In the 20th century, algebraic geometry has split into several subareas.

The main stream of algebraic geometry is devoted to the study of the complex
points of the algebraic varieties and more generally to the points with
coordinates in an algebraically closed field.

The study of the points of an algebraic variety with coordinates in the field
of the rational numbers or in a number field became arithmetic geometry (or
more classically Diophantine geometry), a subfield of algebraic number theory.

The study of the real points of an algebraic variety is the subject of real
algebraic geometry.

A large part of singularity theory is devoted to the singularities of
algebraic varieties.

With the rise of the computers, a computational algebraic geometry area has
emerged, which lies at the intersection of algebraic geometry and computer
algebra. It consists essentially in developing algorithms and software for
studying and finding the properties of explicitly given algebraic varieties.

Much of the development of the main stream of algebraic geometry in the 20th
century occurred within an abstract algebraic framework, with increasing
emphasis being placed on "intrinsic" properties of algebraic varieties not
dependent on any particular way of embedding the variety in an ambient
coordinate space; this parallels developments in topology, differential and
complex geometry. One key achievement of this abstract algebraic geometry is
Grothendieck's scheme theory which allows one to use sheaf theory to study
algebraic varieties in a way which is very similar to its use in the study of
differential and analytic manifolds. This is obtained by extending the notion
of point: In classical algebraic geometry, a point of an affine variety may be
identified, through Hilbert's Nullstellensatz, with a maximal ideal of the
coordinate ring, while the points of the corresponding affine scheme are all
prime ideals of this ring. This means that a point of such a scheme may be
either a usual point or a subvariety. This approach also enables a unification
of the language and the tools of classical algebraic geometry, mainly
concerned with complex points, and of algebraic number theory. Wiles's proof
of the longstanding conjecture called Fermat's last theorem is an example of
the power of this approach.

So, the question is whether this new math can 'modernize' classical physics
and help solve a set of unsolved problems (outside [string
theory)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_quantum_field_theory) ? We,
unfortunately, do not have any answer, but here are a set of papers to look
into, but most are related to string theory only.

[Algebraic Geometry and Physics (2000) ](http://arxiv.org/abs/math-ph/0011038)

> This article is an interdisciplinary review and an on-going progress report
over the last few years made by myself and collaborators in certain
fundamental subjects on two major theoretic branches in mathematics and
theoretical physics: algebraic geometry and quantum physics. I shall take a
practical approach, concentrating more on explicit examples rather than formal
developments. Topics covered are divided in three sections: (I) Algebraic
geometry on two-dimensional exactly solvable statistical lattice models and
its related Hamiltonians: I will report results on the algebraic geometry of
rapidity curves appeared in the chiral Potts model, and the algebraic Bethe
Ansatz equation in connection with quantum inverse scattering method for the
related one-dimensional Hamiltonion chain, e.g., XXZ, Hofstadter type
Hamiltonian. (II) Infinite symmetry algebras arising from quantum spin chain
and conformal field theory: I will explain certain progress made on Onsager
algebra, the relation with the superintegrable chiral Potts quantum chain and
problems on its spectrum. In conformal field theory, mathematical aspects of
characters of N=2 superconformal algebra are discussed, especially on the
modular invariant property connected to the theory. (III). Algebraic geometry
problems on orbifolds stemming from string theory: I will report recent
progress on crepant resolutions of quotient singularity of dimension greater
than or equal to three. The direction of present-day research of engaging
finite group representations in the geometry of orbifolds is briefly reviewed,
and the mathematical aspect of various formulas on the topology of string
vacuum will be discussed.

[Geometric and Algebraic Topological Methods in Quantum
Mechanics](http://arxiv.org/abs/math-ph/0410040)

> In the last decade, the development of new ideas in quantum theory,
including geometric and deformation quantization, the non-Abelian Berry
factor, super- and BRST symmetries, non-commutativity, has called into play
the geometric techniques based on the deep interplay between algebra,
differential geometry and topology. The present book aims at being a guide to
advanced differential geometric and topological methods in quantum mechanics.
Their main peculiarity lies in the fact that geometry in quantum theory speaks
mainly the algebraic language of rings, modules, sheaves and categories.
Geometry is by no means the primary scope of the book, but it underlies many
ideas in modern quantum physics and provides the most advanced schemes of
quantization.

[Noncommutative Geometry and Quiver
algebras](http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/0502.5301)

> We develop a new framework for noncommutative differential geometry based on
double derivations. This leads to the notion of moment map and of Hamiltonian
reduction in noncommutative symplectic geometry. For any smooth associative
algebra B, we define its noncommutative cotangent bundle T^*B, which is a
basic example of noncommutative symplectic manifold. Applying Hamiltonian
reduction to noncommutative cotangent bundles gives an interesting class of
associative algebras, P=P(B), that includes preprojective algebras associated
with quivers. Our formalism of noncommutative Hamiltonian reduction provides
the space P/[P,P] with a Lie algebra structure, analogous to the Poisson
bracket on the zero fiber of the moment map. In the special case where P is
the preprojective algebra associated with a quiver of non-Dynkin type, we give
a complete description of the Gerstenhaber algebra structure on the Hochschild
cohomology of P in terms of the Lie algebra P/[P,P].

[Why can algebraic geometry be applied into theoretical
physics?](http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/527125/why-can-algebraic-
geometry-be-applied-into-theoretical-physics)

> It is to be said at the outset that I do not have much familiarity with
physics beyond what is in a semi-popular book; say, the Feynman Lectures Vol 1
and 2.

As I progressed in math graduate school specializing in number theory and
algebraic geometry, it was astounding to discover a certain class of
researchers who were doing very serious and nontrivial cutting-edge stuff
connecting algebraic geometry and mathematical physics.

At the risk of appearing like a completely naive person, I must confess that I
am completely baffled at how can this be possible. From one perspective,
algebraic geometry is at its basics about studying solutions of algebraic
equations which also have certain geometric aspects. Certainly way of looking
at is not enough. How to philosophically explain this connection?

> To start with, we can look at many different possible spacetimes, and it
turns out that looking at certain algebraic varieties (or more generally,
symplectic manifolds) is very fruitful. There are many reasons for this, but
I'll mention just one: it turns out that the number of algebraic curves in
these varieties is something which appears in physics.

Here is an attempt at explaining one piece of this (warning: I only understand
the mathematical side, so what I say about physics may be completely wrong. If
so, someone who actually knows physics please correct me. Also, note that I do
not know how to explain this in a way that is not at least somewhat handwavy,
though I will try to not say anything false.)

In classical mechanics, there is the Lagrangian formulation. What this says is
that the path of an object must (at least locally) minimize a quantity called
the "action" of the path. The calculus of variations lets us prove that this
is equivalent to Newton's laws.

Now when you go to quantum mechanics (and in particular quantum field theory,
which is where this is really useful), there is the Feynman path integral
formulation: A particle may be treated as taking every path it could possibly
take. However, most of these paths "cancel out" , and the only ones we
actually end up seeing are the ones that are critical points of the action.
What this means is that we can evaluate certain things in quantum field theory
by integrating over all paths, as most of the paths will cancel out. (This
"cancelling out" is something that can happen in quantum mechanics; to give an
analogue, think of wave interference.)

Now if you we start working with strings, then as a string moves, we get a 2d-
surface instead of a path, called the worldsheet of a string. As with the path
integral, we now get integrals over these 2d-surfaces. It now turns out that
the surfaces which don't cancel must be pseudoholomorphic curve, and when our
spacetime is an algebraic variety, this pseudoholomorphic curve corresponds to
an algebraic curve.

So counts of algebraic curves in complex varieties are something which appear
in string theory.

Now of course there is no rigorous formulation of infinite-dimensional
integration in mathematics. Therefore, many of the results obtainable via the
Feynman path integral are not obtainable via traditional techniques, which is
why mathematicians are interested in this relation.

[Why study algebraic geometry?](http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/255063
/why-study-algebraic-geometry) (a very informative comment with many links to
get started on algebraic geometry)

> In my personal case, I started as a theoretical physicists but switched
completely to pure mathematics because of algebraic geometry, and I also began
by self-learning. It is a very deep subject with connections to almost
everything else, once one has learned enough to realize that. It is also a
very demanding field because of the tremendous background one has to master,
in commutative and homological algebra for example, before being able to get
to the most modern and interesting results. The effort nevertheless pays off!
In fact, the route through commutative algebra actually paves the way not only
to algebraic geometry but to algebraic number theory and arithmetic geometry.
I had a strong background in differential geometry so I arrived at algebraic
geometry through complex (Khler) geometry, and ended up fascinated by even the
most abstract incarnations of it.

"Algebraic geometry seems to have acquired the reputation of being esoteric,
exclusive, and very abstract, with adherents who are secretly plotting to take
over all the rest of mathematics. In one respect this last point is
accurate..." - David Mumford.

[Topological quantum field
theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_quantum_field_theory)

> Although TQFTs were invented by physicists, they are also of mathematical
interest, being related to, among other things, knot theory and the theory of
four-manifolds in algebraic topology, and to the theory of moduli spaces in
algebraic geometry. Donaldson, Jones, Witten, and Kontsevich have all won
Fields Medals for work related to topological field theory.

In condensed matter physics, topological quantum field theories are the low
energy effective theories of topologically ordered states, such as fractional
quantum Hall states, string-net condensed states, and other strongly
correlated quantum liquid states.

Regarding the original question, we have not seen much application in
condensed matter physics, but may be because we have not looked hard enough.

**GAGA Paper** of Jean-Pierre Serre connects [algebraic geometry and analytic geometry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GAGA#GAGA). 

> Foundations for the many relations between the two theories were put in
place during the early part of the 1950s, as part of the business of laying
the foundations of algebraic geometry to include, for example, techniques from
Hodge theory. The major paper consolidating the theory was Gometrie Algbrique
et Gomtrie Analytique Serre (1956) by Serre, now usually referred to as GAGA.
It proves general results that relate classes of algebraic varieties, regular
morphisms and sheaves with classes of analytic spaces, holomorphic mappings
and sheaves. It reduces all of these to the comparison of categories of
sheaves.

Nowadays the phrase GAGA-style result is used for any theorem of comparison,
allowing passage between a category of objects from algebraic geometry, and
their morphisms, to a well-defined subcategory of analytic geometry objects
and holomorphic mappings.
