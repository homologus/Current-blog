> Understanding the molecular underpinnings of evolutionary adaptations is a
central focus of modern evolutionary biology. Recent studies have uncovered a
panoply of complex phenotypes, including locally adapted ecotypes and cryptic
morphs, divergent social behaviours in birds and insects, as well as
alternative metabolic pathways in plants and fungi, that are regulated by
clusters of tightly linked loci. These supergenes segregate as stable
polymorphisms within or between natural populations and influence ecologically
relevant traits. Some supergenes may span entire chromosomes, because
selection for reduced recombination between a supergene and a nearby locus
providing additional benefits can lead to locus expansions with dynamics
similar to those known for sex chromosomes. In addition to allowing for the
co-segregation of adaptive variation within species, supergenes may facilitate
the spread of complex phenotypes across species boundaries. Application of new
genomic methods is likely to lead to the discovery of many additional
supergenes in a broad range of organisms and reveal similar genetic
architectures for convergently evolved phenotypes.
