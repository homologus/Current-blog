> LINKS is a genomics application for scaffolding or re-scaffolding genome
assemblies with long reads, such as those produced by Oxford Nanopore
Technologies Ltd. It provides a generic framework for scaffolding and can work
on any sequences. Fill gaps in LINKS-derived scaffolds using Sealer
(http://www.bcgsc.ca/platform/bioinfo/software/sealer).
