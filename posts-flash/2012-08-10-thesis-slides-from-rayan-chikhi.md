Over the last few days, we have been working hard to fully understand the
papers by [Conway/Bromage, Pell et al. and Rayan
Chikhi](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/2012/07/19/quip-minia-slimgene-and-titus-
browns-paper-on-scaling-metagenome/), who all presented methods to build low
RAM de Bruijn assemblers. Among all three, the stats of [Minia
program](http://minia.genouest.org/minia.pdf) by Rayan are so good that we
requested his code to understand how he does it.

Slides.pdf) that you may enjoy. For impatient ones, the most important chart
is attached below -
