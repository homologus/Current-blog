I am reading Morris Berman's '[Neurotic Beauty - An Outsider's Look at Japan](
https://books.google.com/books/about/Neurotic_Beauty.html?id=MAC1rQEACAAJ)'.
It is a great book and very insightful on people and history. Strangely, I
cannot find any link at Amazon, although I remember seeing it a few weeks
back.

Based on [his earlier books](http://www.amazon.com/Dark-Ages-America-Final-
Empire/dp/0393329771), I find Berman far more insightful than George Friedman.
In fact, the difference is so great that even making such a comparison would
be insulting to Berman. No wonder he packed up and moved outside USA, while
Friedman became the chief adviser of various government agencies.
