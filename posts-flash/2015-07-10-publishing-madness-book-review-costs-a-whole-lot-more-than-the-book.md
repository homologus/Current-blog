Sometimes you come across examples convincingly showing that the publishing
world has gone insane. I came across the suggestion of an interesting book -
["How to Succeed in School Without Really Learning: The Credentials Race in
American Education"](http://www.amazon.com/Succeed-School-Without-Really-
Learning/dp/0300078676), and decided to check at Amazon. It costs $25, but you
can buy almost new used copies for $10.

Before hitting the 'buy' button, I decided to check for online reviews and
came across a review by John F. Covaleskie in a journal. Strangely, the review
costs $40, on top of which you will have to pay bunch of other taxes like VAT
!!

American Education, by David F.

Anyone with understanding of free market would expect that a review from 1999
to cost a lot less than the used book. So, the above demonstration suggests
that 'free market' does not exist in the publishing market. Is it monopoly
pricing (cartel pricing) or something more?
