While searching in Google for information on [Brian
Josephson](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/2013/03/07/did-josephson-lose-his-mind-
or-was-he-ahead-of-his-time/), we came across another interesting story that
we missed earlier. Ivar Giaever, who shared Nobel prize with Josephson, came
out strongly against the pseudoscience of global warming. How strongly? He
went to the extent of [resigning from American Physical
Society](http://www.climatedepot.com/a/12797/Exclusive-Nobel-PrizeWinning-
Physicist-Who-Endorsed-Obama-Dissents-Resigns-from-American-Physical-Society-
Over-Groups-Promotion-of-ManMade-Global-Warming), because APS politicized its
mission with a statement on global warming.

His opponents discarded his views as irrelevant, because he was not an expert
in the glorious 'climate science' and therefore not supposed to say anything.
There was one tiny bit of problem though. Giaever's [1973 Nobel award
speech](http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1973/giaever-
lecture.pdf) ended with the following paragraph -

> In conclusion I hope that this rather personal account may provide some
slight insight into the nature of scientific discovery. My own beliefs are
that the road to a scientific discovery is seldom direct, and that it does not
necessarily require great expertise. In fact, I am convinced that often a
newcomer to a field has a great advantage because he is ignorant and does not
know all the complicated reasons why a particular experiment should not be
attempted. However, it is essential to be able to get advice and help from
experts in the various sciences when you need it. For me the most important
ingredients were that I was at the right place at the right time and that I
found so many friends both inside and outside General Electric who unselfishly
supported me.

It is fascinating to find scientists like Laughlin and Giaever being pushed
aside to maintain a bank-controlled globalized agenda of central planning.
'Scientists' of today are not seeker of truth any more and instead they
worship a different God. Which God? If [Titus Brown's subtle hint did not
help](http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/why-i-blog-2013-version.html), here is
someone who presents it more explicitly. The arrangement is so absurd that
sometimes we have no response other than asking child-like questions, but we
guess the others do not even perceive the absurdity of their new kind of
science.
