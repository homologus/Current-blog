We did not get a chance to read this paper submitted to biorxiv. Is it about
long reads or long noisy reads?

> Genome assemblies that are accurate, complete, and contiguous are essential
for identifying important structural and functional elements of genomes and
for identifying genetic variation. Nevertheless, most recent genome assemblies
remain incomplete and fragmented. While long molecule sequencing promises to
deliver more complete genome assemblies with fewer gaps, concerns about error
rates, low yields, stringent DNA requirements, and uncertainty about best
practices may discourage many investigators from adopting this technology.
Here, in conjunction with the gold standard Drosophila melanogaster reference
genome, we analyze recently published long molecule sequencing data to
identify what governs completeness and contiguity of genome assemblies. We
also present a meta-assembly tool for improving contiguity of final assemblies
constructed via different methods. Our results motivate a set of preliminary
best practices for assembly, a 'missing manual' that guides key decisions in
building high quality de novo genome assemblies, from DNA isolation to
polishing the assembly.
