You will love the next set of tutorials we are currently working on. We are
definitely very excited about them !!
<!--more-->

Those tutorials will provide big picture view of a large set of software and
hardware concepts often used by bioinformaticians. Hardware technologies like
Hadoop, FPGA, GPU etc. and software concepts related to various programming
languages and algorithms will all be presented.

They are not meant to turn you into an expert in each of those technologies,
but you will have enough perspectives to know whether to pursue those
solutions.
