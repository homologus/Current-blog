A few weeks back, we [posted a stunning video of
Siphonophore](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/ncrna/2014/07/29/stunning-
siphonophore/) living deep in the ocean (pelagic) -

Anyone watching the video says double wow, when he realizes that the odd
creature is not one multicellular animal, but a colony of multi-cellular
animals (edited). Siphonophores play unique role in evolution of multicellular
animals, and we also mentioned Casey Dunn's interesting work on trying to
understand them at the molecular level.

Today we came across [a bioarxiv paper by his
group](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2014/10/29/010868) that the readers
may find interesting.

> The siphonophore Nanomia bijuga is a pelagic hydrozoan (Cnidaria) with
complex morphological organization. Each siphonophore is made up of many
asexually produced, genetically identical zooids that are functionally
specialized and morphologically distinct. These zooids predominantly arise by
budding in two growth zones, and are arranged in precise patterns. This study
describes the cellular anatomy of several zooid types as well as of the stem
and gas-filled float, called the pneumatophore. The distribution of cellular
morphologies across zooid types enhances our understanding of zooid function.
The unique absorptive cells in the palpon, for example, indicate specialized
intracellular digestive processing in this zooid type. Furthermore, there are
multiple areas of both endodermal and ectodermal epithelial complexity. Though
cnidarians are usually thought of as mono-epithelial, we characterize at least
two cellular populations in this species which are not connected to a basement
membrane. This work provides a greater understanding of epithelial diversity
within the cnidarians, and will be a foundation for future studies on Nanomia
bijuga, including functional assays and gene expression analyses.
