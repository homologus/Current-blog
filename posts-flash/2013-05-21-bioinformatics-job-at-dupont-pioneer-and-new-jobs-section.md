From time to time, we get requests from readers to post about new job openings
at their organizations. To accommodate them and help our community, we decided
to start a [jobs section](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/jobs/) and also created
[a new board in our forum for job
posting](http://www.homolog.us/smf/index.php?board=3.0).

Please feel free to send other notifications on job opening and we will post
them in the appropriate boards. For the time being, we will mention new job
posting here until we get overwhelmed with too many requests !!

The one being posted today came from Kevin A Fengler at Dupont Pioneer located
in Johnston, IA and he is interested in hiring a 'senior research associate -
bioinformatics'. You can check the details [at this
