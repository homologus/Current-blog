We started with trying to implement Docker-based pipelines, and came to give
up not only on Docker ([Is Docker for
Suckers?](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/blog/2015/09/22/is-docker-for-

Now we have a hypervisor, an amazingly secure and stable O/S, and
containers...plus a number of other hardware features never available to Linux
users.

Stay tuned for more information !!
