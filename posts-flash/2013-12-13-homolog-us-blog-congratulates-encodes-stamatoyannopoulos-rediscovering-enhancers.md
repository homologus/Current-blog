Stamatoyannopoulos made another breakthrough discovery !! At this rate, he
will figure out Darwin's theory of evolution by the end of next year.

We have to [bring back the old
video](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/blog/2013/07/29/uw-alumni-early-
achievement-award-2013-dr-john-stamatoyannopoulos/) that will be exclusively
reserved for him from now on.

For those not yet familiar with the current claim, following two press
releases would suffice.

[Second Code Uncovered Inside the DNA](http://science.time.com/2013/12/13

> A research team at the University of Washington has discovered a second code
hidden within the DNA, written on top of the other.

Now we know that this basic assumption about reading the human genome missed
half of the picture, said team leader Dr. John Stamatoyannopoulos.

Whereas the first code describes how proteins are made, this second language
instructs the cell on how genes are to be controlled.

> With todays headlines hyping Second Code Uncovered Inside the DNA, you might
think that scientists are running around in circles in their labs, tearing out
their hair, and screaming, Crick, you loser! But the real reaction of
scientists to these headlines is more along the lines of this Twitter
conversation among several scientific experts and science writers. They have
good reason to be snarky.
