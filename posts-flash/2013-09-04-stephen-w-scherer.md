When they are not complaining about sequester, they work on serious problems
hurting our society. One such problem was detected on Sept 2. Apparently the
[wikipedia page of a
scientist](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stephen_W._Scherer) was
'inflated'.

The guy is intellectually dishonest for two reasons.

1\. If he points out the obvious thing that the money spent on war is money
not spent on research, he will lose his job the next day. Why not play guitar
and make a mockery of his life instead?

2\. In other part of his life, he preaches 'Christian Morality' !!

> "In my view," Collins goes on to say, "DNA sequence alone, even if
accompanied by a vast trove of data on biological function, will never explain
certain special human attributes, **such as the knowledge of the Moral Law and
the universal search for God.**

Preaching Christian morality as a member of war-mongering government? Talk
about hypocrisy.
