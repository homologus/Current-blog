> Recently, a number of protocols extending RNA-sequencing to the single-cell
regime have been published. However, we were concerned that the additional
steps to deal with such minute quantities of input sample would introduce
serious biases that would make analysis of the data using existing approaches
invalid. In this study, we performed a critical evaluation of several of these
low-volume RNA-seq protocols, and found that they performed slightly less well
in per-gene linearity of response, but with at least two orders of magnitude
less sample required. We also explored a simple modification to one of these
protocols that, for many samples, reduced the cost of library preparation to
approximately $20/sample.
