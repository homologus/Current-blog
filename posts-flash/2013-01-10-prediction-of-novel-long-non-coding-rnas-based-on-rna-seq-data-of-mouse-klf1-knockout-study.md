> We present a computational pipeline for detecting novel lncRNAs from the
RNA-Seq data. First, the genome-guided transcriptome reconstruction is used to
generate initially assembled transcripts. The possible partial transcripts and
artefacts are filtered according to the quantified expression level. After
that, novel lncRNAs are detected by further filtering known transcripts and
those with high protein coding potential, using a newly developed program
called lncRScan. We applied our pipeline to a mouse Klf1 knockout dataset, and
discussed the plausible functions of the novel lncRNAs we detected by
differential expression analysis. We identified 308 novel lncRNA candidates,
which have shorter transcript length, fewer exons, shorter putative open
reading frame, compared with known protein-coding transcripts. Of the lncRNAs,
52 large intergenic ncRNAs (lincRNAs) show lower expression level than the
protein-coding ones and 13 lncRNAs represent significant differential
expression between the wild-type and Klf1 knockout conditions.
