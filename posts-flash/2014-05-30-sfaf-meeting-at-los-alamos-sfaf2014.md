SFAF ("Sequencing, Finishing and Analysis in the Future") 2014 Meeting is
taking place at Los Alamos, and readers can follow all discussions by checking
the twitter [hashtag
#SFAF2014](https://twitter.com/hashtag/SFAF2014?src=hash). The above picture

> Sequencing, Finishing and Analysis in the Future (SFAF) is an annual meeting
dedicated to bringing together experts in the genomics fieldincluding
representatives from the industries that serve this specialized scientific
community.

The meeting focuses on laboratory methods and computational tools used to help
sequence, assemble, and finish genomes, including new sequencing technologies,
which promise high-throughput results by sequencing more base-pairs per run at
longer read-lengths.

The agenda for the meeting is available from [this
link](http://www.lanl.gov/conferences/sequencing-finishing-analysis-
future/agenda.php). A number of talks caught our attention, but we have not
got time to follow twitter to find what was presented. If you are one of the
mentioned speakers, would you please send the slides or other materials for
our readers? Others are welcome too !

**1\. A de novo Whole Genome Shotgun Assembler for Long Reads (Gene Myers)**

**2\. New Frontiers of Genome Assembly with SPAdes 3.1 (Anton Korobeynikov)**

**3\. Speeding up NGS software development (D. Lavenier)**

**4\. Assembly and Phasing of Polymorphic Heterozygous Diploid Genomes (Jason Chin)**

**5\. Efficient de novo assembly of long NGS reads (Martin Simonsen)**
