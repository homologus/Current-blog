> Farmer-managed natural regeneration (FMNR) is a low-cost, sustainable land-
restoration technique used to combat poverty and hunger amongst poor
subsistence farmers in developing countries by increasing food and timber
production, and resilience to climate extremes. It involves the systematic
regeneration and management of trees and shrubs from tree stumps, roots and
seeds.[1]

> For centuries, farmers in the Sahel, a band of land that crosses Africa at
the southern fringe of the Sahara Desert, used rotational tree farming to
provide year-round harvests and a consistent source of food, fuel, and
fertilizer. But severe droughts and rapid population growth in the 1970s and
80s significantly degraded the Sahel's farmland, leading to the loss of many
indigenous tree species and leaving the soil barren and eroded. With the loss
of the trees went the knowledge, traditions, and practices that had kept the
region fertile for hundreds of years.
