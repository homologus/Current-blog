A few days back, we posted [the
summary](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/blog/2015/08/26/gene-myers-at-the-pacbio-
bioinformatics-workshop-follow-smrtbfx-in-twitter/) and [the
slides](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/blog/2015/08/27/slides-from-gene-myers/)
of Gene Myers' talk at the recent bioinformatics workshop arranged by Pacbio.
Readers interested in the remaining talks will find the following slides
useful. While reading the slides, you may go to #SMRTBFX hashtag in twitter to
find out snippets from the corresponding talks.

We are building an online teaching module ([same model as
this](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/blog/2015/09/01/scripting-for-biology-
online-virtual-classroom-based-module/)) on algorithms and programs related to
analysis of long noisy reads, and Jason Chin has been gracious enough to help
us with it. If you are interested in taking the class, please email 'pandora
at homolog.us' and we will let you know, when the module is ready.
