Here is the not-so-funny component - bank run in UK of all place?

[Bank-Run Fears Continue; HSBC Restricts Large Cash
Withdrawals](http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2014-01-24/bank-run-fears-continue-
hsbc-restricts-large-cash-withdrawals)

"When we presented them with the withdrawal slip, they declined to give us the
money because we could not provide them with a satisfactory explanation for
what the money was for. They wanted a letter from the person involved."

Mr Cotton says the staff refused to tell him how much he could have: "So I
wrote out a few slips. I said, 'Can I have 5,000?' They said no. I said, 'Can
I have 4,000?' They said no. And then I wrote one out for 3,000 and they said,
'OK, we'll give you that.' "

He asked if he could return later that day to withdraw another 3,000, but he
was told he could not do the same thing twice in one day.

...

Mr Cotton cannot understand HSBC's attitude: "I've been banking in that bank
for 28 years. They all know me in there. You shouldn't have to explain to your
bank why you want that money. It's not theirs, it's yours."
