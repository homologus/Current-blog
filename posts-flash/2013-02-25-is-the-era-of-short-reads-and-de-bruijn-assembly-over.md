title: Is the Era of Short Reads and de Bruijn Assembly Over?

Even though Oxford Nanopore did not come back to AGBT this year, other
presentations suggest that long reads are back in vogue. The usual culprits -
PacBio and Moleculo - seem to be carrying the torch. We have not gone through
all discussions yet, but readers may take a look at [PacBio
Blog](http://blog.pacificbiosciences.com/2013_02_01_archive.html) and this
article - "[A coming of age for PacBio and long read sequencing? #AGBT13](http

cing___AGBT___)" for useful information.

Our reader Jason Chin of PacBio presented a highly informative poster on his
HGap assembly algorithm, but we did not find a public source from where it can
be downloaded.

Edit. Here is Chen-Shan's poster (click on image to get to pdf):

Edit.

Omics! Omics! blog provides very good perspective PacBio vs Moleculo, as well
as on where the major future challenges lie.

Sequencing](http://omicsomics.blogspot.com/2013/02/post-agbt-longish-item-on-

> For application space, most examples given at AGBT were either genome
assembly (including gap filling and other improvements), structural variant
discovery and haplotyping. One poster showed the use of PacBio for cDNA
sequencing, which will certainly be a boon to cataloging splice variants.
Metagenomics applications came up in Q&A;, but I dont believe any talks or
posters actually showed this.
