[A Review of Bioinformatics Algorithms An Active Learning Approach by Compeau
and Pevzner](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/blog/2014/07/30/a-review-of-
bioinformatics-algorithms-an-active-learning-approach-by-compeau-and-pevzner/)

Those who have (or do not have) the book can also listen to Pevzner/Compeau's
lectures from a large number of videos posted in youtube. We are posting two
interesting ones here.
