Regular readers are familiar with Rayan, whose excellent research work has
been [extensively featured here](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/2012/08/10
/thesis-slides-from-rayan-chikhi/) (Note to readers: Today we added his PhD
thesis in previous link). Rayan also made an amazing accomplishment of solving
[all 66 Rosalind bioinformatics problems
correctly](http://rosalind.info/statistics/top/). Are the toppers of the list
[an investment banker](http://www.linkedin.com/in/vmozgin) and [father of
banker or all
bankers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Eccles_%28businessman%29)?

[We wrote](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/2012/09/18/rosalind-project-at-
algorithmic-biology-laboratory-st-petersburg/) about Rosalind earlier. [It is
a cool project](http://rosalind.info/problems/as-table/) by Algorithmic
Biology lab at St. Petersburg to teach bioinformatics through problem solving.

Enjoy !!

We started Rosalind and stumbled on the simple problem of computing GC level.
After three tries, we realized that the file being downloaded from Rosalind
comes in dos format in our computer, while we were loading it in unix format.
Dos adds nasty end of line characters, which only go away with 'dos2unix'
command. After we did 'dos2unix' on input file, GC levels matched Rosalind's
answer.

Maybe others are stumbling at GC level for the same reason.
