Burrows Wheeler Transform is an important component of alignment algorithms
like Bowtie, BWA, and assembly algorithm such as [String Graph
Assembler](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/2012/02/11/string-graph-assembler/).

Few months back, [we explained](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/2011/10/03
/finding-us-in-homolog-us/) how Burrows Wheeler Transform works through an
example. This time we decided to present the same information as an animation.
Please check the following links. The word in red box represents Burrows
Wheeler transform of the original text.

The second animation was described in text form in [this earlier
commentary](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/2011/10/05/finding-us-in-homolog-us-
part-ii/).

Please tell us what you think. If you like them, there will be more.
