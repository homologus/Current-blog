Why do some proteins get born and some do not? [Grzegorz Szoniec and Maciej J
Ogorzalek attempts to find out](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC36
71101/pdf/40064_2012_Article_301.pdf).

> Existing and known proteins are only a small subset of all possible
sequences. Why were only some proteins selected during evolution? The reason
is not known but two possible ways are considered: deterministic and random.
To investigate theoretical sequences of amino acids a term Never Born Protein
was introduced (Chiarabelli et al. 2006). Since 2006 only a few papers about
them have been published. The most significant research has shown that 20% of
them fold (i.e. reach stable and functional 3D structure) in laboratory
conditions

It is a theoretical paper, where they generated Never Born Proteins with
Random Blast tool and compared with natural proteins from Uniprot by measuring
block entropy in both cases.

Findings and conclusion:

> Findings

Both block and relative entropies are similar what means that both protein
kinds contain strongly random sequences.

An artificially generated Never Born protein sequence is closely as random as
a natural one.

Conclusions

Information theory approach suggests that protein selection during evolution
was rather random/non-deterministic.

Natural proteins have no noticeable unique features in information theory
sense.
