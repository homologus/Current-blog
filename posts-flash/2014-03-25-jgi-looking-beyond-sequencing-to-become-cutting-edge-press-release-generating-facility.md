Time to have some fun at the cost of JGI :)

A Genome Web press release from today says -

[JGI Aims to Move Beyond Sequencing, Become 'Cutting Edge' Genomics
Facility](http://www.genomeweb.com//node/1366991)

which takes you to the 2012 press release -

[JGI Looking Beyond Whole Genomes to Epigenetics, Genome Finishing, and
Single-Cell Sequencing](http://www.genomeweb.com/sequencing/jgi-looking-
beyond-whole-genomes-epigenetics-genome-finishing-and-single-cell-se)

Oh well !!

\--------------------------------------

...but seriously, can JGI rebrand itself as a competitive business?

**1\. Cost structure**

[We have the JGI numbers from an old commentary on PacBio
-](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/blog/2013/09/22/end-short-read-era-part-ii/)

> The company is burning 80 million dollars every year at the latest quarterly
run rate. With 342 employees, that is $234K per employee. I compared the
numbers to JGIs, and Alex Copelands talk was helpful in giving us the number.
At $65 million/year and 250 employees, JGIs run rate is $260K/employee.
Illumina, at $652 million for 2400 employees, is in the same ballpark
$272K/employee.

Are they competitive with BGI? One can argue that the JGI employees are
experienced, but the organization will have to either (i) hire many helping
hands working for lower pay (cannot compete with universities), or (ii) burn
out the experienced people.

**2\. Technology**

Do they have technological edge and will they be able to maintain
technological edge? I am not sure. It seems like BGI has developed an edge in
NGS algorithms through their collaboration with HKU, whereas JGI did not get
much from Berkeley.

**3\. Business area**

Broad has taken over cancer and medical-related sequencing. Also, NY genome
center has been set up to take over the same space. Therefore, sequencing
human genomes is likely off-limit for JGI.

For plant and other genomes, JGI will have to compete with numerous other
burgeoning core facilities, who all has bought their own machines.

Clearly, JGI will have to find some kind of niche area here.
