"The results show that in **all fields but biology** a significant citation
advantage exists in terms of speed and citation rates for articles with a
previous preprint version on arXiv." - Hmmm? Is Biology unique?

> This paper quantifies to which extent preprints in arXiv accelerate
scholarly communication. The following subject fields were investigated up to
the year 2012: High Energy Physics (HEP), Mathematics, Astrophysics,
Quantitative Biology, and Library and Information Science (LIS). Publication
and citation data was downloaded from Scopus and matched with corresponding
preprints in arXiv. Furthermore, the INSPIRE HEP database was used to retrieve
citation data for papers related to HEP. The bibliometric analysis deals with
the growth in numbers of articles published having a previous preprint in
arXiv and the publication delay, which is defined as the chronological
distance between the deposit of a preprint in arXiv and its formal journal
publication. Likewise, the citation delay is analyzed, which describes the
time it takes until the first citation of preprints, and articles,
respectively. Total citation numbers are compared for sets of articles with a
previous preprint and those without. The results show that in all fields but
biology a significant citation advantage exists in terms of speed and citation
rates for articles with a previous preprint version on arXiv.
