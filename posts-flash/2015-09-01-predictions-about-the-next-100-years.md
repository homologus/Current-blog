If you want to know what the next 100 years will look like,
[here](http://www.amazon.com/The-Next-100-Years-Forecast/dp/0767923057) is the
perfect book for you. Remember that you need to take all predictions in
'contrarian mode', or expect the exact opposite of what the author said would
happen.

George Friedman predicts the collapse and breakdown of Russia in 2020,
complete crash of 'paper tiger' Chinese economy in 2030, rise of three great
empires - Japan, Poland and Turkey, who will all go into world war with USA in
2060 and then finally war between Mexico and USA in 2090 with Mexico claiming
a large part of southern USA. Talk about sheer arrogance of trying to predict
events in 2090, except that George Friedman was the brain behind the security
analysis organization Startfor that gets [huge subscriptions money from CIA
and other US government bigshots](http://www.zerohedge.com/news/anonymous-
explains-why-27-million-stratfor-emails-were-hacked). So, what he writes about
is the conventional wisdom. Bet against it and you will be on the right track.
