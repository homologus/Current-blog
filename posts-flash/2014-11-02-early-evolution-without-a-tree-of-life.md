Here is an [wonderful review
paper](http://www.biologydirect.com/content/6/1/36) on origin of eukaryotes by
Bill Martin. Anyone interested in the topic should start with this paper.

> Life is a chemical reaction. Three major transitions in early evolution are
considered without recourse to a tree of life. The origin of prokaryotes
required a steady supply of energy and electrons, probably in the form of
molecular hydrogen stemming from serpentinization. Microbial genome evolution
is not a treelike process because of lateral gene transfer and the
endosymbiotic origins of organelles. The lack of true intermediates in the
prokaryote to eukaryote transition has a bioenergetic cause.

Dr. Martin starts with discussing how the tree concept is invalid in
prokaryotes. He also reviews the current understanding on the major problems
in biology. In addition to the paper itself, the review sections are
excellent. You can learn a lot by seeing the comments from Graur, Koonin and
others.
