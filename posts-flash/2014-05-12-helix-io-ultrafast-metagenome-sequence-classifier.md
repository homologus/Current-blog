> How it works - Enter a sequence or upload a file. Our server then processes
your query or file. All data is sent securely via HTTPS, and we delete all
uploads after processing.

Wait (Just a very brief moment) - We compare the sequence against reference
genomes from the NCBI. More details are provided in our Technical FAQ.

View results - We provide tabular, graphical, and downloadable results.
Optional public permalinks are also available.

follow up comments. We wonder whether the algorithm is similar to rapsearch
mentioned [in this post](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/blog/2014/04/06/2014-the-
year-of-minimizers-in-bioinformatics/)?
