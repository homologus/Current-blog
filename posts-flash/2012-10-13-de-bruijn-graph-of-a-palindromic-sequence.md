Palindromic nucleotide sequences are those matching their reverse complements.
Here is an example
-"ATACGTCATTCAAATATGTATATACATACATATTCGAATATGTATGTATATACATATTTGAATGACGTAT".
Another one is "CATGTGACTTTATAGCAGCATGCTGCTATAAAGTCACATG". We did not make
those sequences up. They are taken from chromosome 1 of human genome.

Here is the de Bruijn graph of one of the above sequences with 7-mers. We are
using the convention of showing only the lexicographically smaller 7-mer.

The above graph is constructed in a hurry and may have one or two errors, even
though the general structure is correct.

Enjoy !!
