Public Announcement: Genome assembly experts - who wants to handle [Raj's
question](http://www.homolog.us/smf/index.php?topic=69.msg113#msg113) on 3GB
mammalian genome assembly? It combines all complexities of modern genome
assembly including multiple technologies, pacbio and so on.

\-----------------------------

Three things to note in Deanna Church's slides:

1\. "The assembled genome is a model". It is good that the point is
increasingly being recognized by researchers.

2\. Human genome is the most expensive and most thoroughly checked genome
among all large ones. So, those working on any other genome sequence need to
cautious before inferring anything based on the sequence.

3\. "Rong Chen (Personalis): even when the same genome is sequenced twice
using 50X Illumina, 6% of variants differ."
