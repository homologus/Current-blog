[NASA Chief Scientist Ellen Stofan Predicts We'll Find Signs Of Alien Life
Within 10 Years](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/08/nasa-alien-

> NASA's top scientist predicts that we'll find signs of alien life by 2025,
with even stronger evidence for extraterrestrials in the years that follow.

"I think we're going to have strong indications of life beyond Earth within a
decade, and I think we're going to have definitive evidence within 20 to 30
years," NASA chief scientist Ellen Stofan said Tuesday during a panel event on
water in the universe.

"We know where to look. We know how to look," Stofan added. "In most cases we
have the technology, and we're on a path to implementing it. And so I think
we're definitely on the road."

Others at the panel agreed.
