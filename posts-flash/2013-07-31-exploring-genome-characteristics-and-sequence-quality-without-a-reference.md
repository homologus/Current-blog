[Very Helpful Preprocessing Module for Those Interested in Assembling
Genomes](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/blog/2013/07/02/cool-preprocessing-model-
for-genome-assembly/)

If you used the module and do not know what to cite, Jared posted the related
paper at the [arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1307.8026v1.pdf).

> The de novo assembly of large, complex genomes is a signi cant challenge
with currently available DNA sequencing technology. While many

de novo assembly software packages are available, comparatively little
attention has been paid to assisting the user with the assembly. This paper

addresses the practical aspects of de novo assembly by introducing new

ways to perform quality assessment on a collection of DNA sequence reads.

The software implementation calculates per-base error rates, paired-end

fragment size histograms and coverage metrics in the absence of a reference
genome. Additionally, the software will estimate characteristics of

the sequenced genome, such as repeat content and heterozygosity, that are

key determinants of assembly diculty. The software described is freely

available and open source under the GNU Public License.
