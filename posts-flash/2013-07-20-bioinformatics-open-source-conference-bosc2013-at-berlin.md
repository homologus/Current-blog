**BIOLOGICAL SEQUENCE ANALYSIS IN THE POST-DATA ERA 

Sean Eddy**

Sean Eddy's talk seems to be the high point of the conference. Bedtools from
@aaronquinlan's got honorable mention in his talk.

It contains many useful insights such as the following one.

> From this: general advice to not do incremental engineering is wrong. A lot
of great work came from incremental engineering: automobiles, sequence
analysis (Smith Waterman -> BLAST -> PSI-BLAST -> HMMER). Engineering is a
valuable part of science. Requires insane dedication to a single problem. The
truth: science rewards for how much impact you have, not how many papers you
write. Arbitrage approach to science: take ideas and tools and make them
usable for biologists who need them. Not traditionally valuable but useful so
can carve out a niche.
