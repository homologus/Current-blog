Linkage and association studies have mapped thousands of genomic regions that
contribute to phenotypic variation, but narrowing these regions to the
underlying causal genes and variants has proven much more challenging.
Resolution of genetic mapping is limited by the recombination rate. We
developed a method that uses CRISPR to build mapping panels with targeted
recombination events. We tested the method by generating a panel with
recombination events spaced along a yeast chromosome arm, mapping trait
variation, and then targeting a high density of recombination events to the
region of interest. Using this approach, we fine-mapped manganese sensitivity
to a single polymorphism in the transporter Pmr1. Targeting recombination
events to regions of interest allows us to rapidly and systematically identify
causal variants underlying trait differences.
