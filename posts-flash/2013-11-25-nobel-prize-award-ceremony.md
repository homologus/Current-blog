prizewinners -- it happened this week at the Swedish embassy compound at the
gathering of this year's Nobelists:

Economics if one wants to call it a science seemed unable to explain the
oscillations of the market, he said.

I see these fluctuations and they make zero sense to me, Professor Karplus
declared. Maybe they make sense to you.

premise factually incorrect.

The hard scientists, more amused than chastened, turned to mocking the
economists.

Youre asking about a very fundamental question, on what the nature of life is,
James Rothman, a professor of cell biology at Yale University and one of the
three newly minted laureates in medicine, told one questioner. I dont think
theres anyone here even the economists who would have an opinion on that for
sure.
