> The discovery that the machinery of the Clustered Regularly Interspaced
Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 bacterial immune system can be re-
purposed to easily create deletions, insertions and replacements in the
mammalian genome has revolutionized the field of genome engineering and re-
invigorated the field of gene therapy. Many parallels have been drawn between
the newly discovered CRISPR-Cas9 system and the RNA interference (RNAi)
pathway in terms of their utility for understanding and interrogating gene
function in mammalian cells. Given this similarity, the CRISPR-Cas9 field
stands to benefit immensely from lessons learned during the development of
RNAi technology. We examine how the history of RNAi can inform today's
challenges in CRISPR-Cas9 genome engineering such as efficiency, specificity,
high-throughput screening and delivery for in vivo and therapeutic
applications.
