Diatoms have very strong silicon cell walls. Transformation is not easy.

A number of new papers are coming out claiming that they can do it.

[Transformation of diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum by electroporation and
establishment of inducible selection
marker](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22676181)

> Diatoms are important primary producers in the marine ecosystem. Currently
it is difficult to genetically transform diatoms due to the technical
limitations of existing methods. The promoter/terminator of the nitrate
reductase gene of the model diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum was cloned and
used to drive chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene
expression. The construct was transferred by electroporation into P.
tricornutum grown in medium lacking silicon. CAT expression was induced in
transformed diatoms in the presence of nitrate, enabling growth in selective
medium, and was repressed when ammonium was the only nitrogen source.
Expression of CAT transcript and protein were demonstrated by RT-PCR and
Western blot analysis, respectively. Our study is the first to report a
successful genetic transformation of diatom by electroporation in an
economical and efficient manner and provides a tightly regulated inducible
gene expression system for diatom.
