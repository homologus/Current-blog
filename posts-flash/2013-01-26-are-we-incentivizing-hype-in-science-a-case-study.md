[forums](http://timotheepoisot.fr/2013/01/24/where-to-submit/) on the
[incentives for
scientists](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/339/6118/386.full) to publish
their work in this venue or another. Some of these discussions cite [our
manuscript on the pernicious consequences of journal
rank](http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3748), others don't. In our manuscript, we
speculate that the scientific community may be facing a deluge of fraud and
misconduct, because of the incentives to publish in high-ranking journals, a
central point of contention in the discussions lnked to above. An example of
just how subtle these incentives may skew the scientific debate, even in the
absence of any obvious misconduct, happened to land on my desk this morning in
the form of a [paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2012.12.038) quite close
to my own field of research, published in the (for our field) very highly
ranked journal "[Current Biology](http://current-biology.com)".  
  
This paper caught my attention not only because it concerned fly behavior or
featured a colleague I happen to know quite well, but because it stated in the
abstract that: "blocking synaptic output from octopamine neurons inverts the
valence assigned to CO2 and elicits an aversive response in flight". We
currently have a few projects in our lab that target these octopamine neurons,
so this was a potentially very important finding. It was my postdoc, [Julien
Colomb](http://lab.brembs.net/author/jcolomb/?showall=yes), who spotted the
problem with this statement first, in Fig. 3 (click for larger image):

biol_fig3.png)  
  
The important data to look at is in Fig. 3D. It shows an attraction for CO2
vs. air in wildtype flies (WT), but an aversion in the genetically manipulated
flies (Tdc2-GAL4/UAS-TNT). This is what is stated in the abstract: wildtype
flies are attracted to CO2 and flies where octopamine release is blocked,
avoid CO2. However, the important control experiments, are those that test for
off-target effects of the genetic manipulation. In other words, do the
transgenes inserted into the fly genome have an effect of their own,
independent of their combined effect on octopamine? In this case, there are
two transgenes, a GAL4 transgene (the driver) and a UAS transgene (the
effector). Their CO2 scores are shown at the end (Tdc2-GAL4/+ and UAS-TNT/+,
respectively). Interestingly, these lines both show a strongly reduced
preference for CO2. Their preference is so strongly reduced that it is not
even different from that for air. To put it differently: neither of both
control lines show normal, wild type behavior. They may not be able to detect
CO2 any more, or have secondary alterations that simply reduce the preference
for CO2, or a myriad of other explanations. Importantly, nobody can know if
these two effects, which either alone already reduce the preference for CO2
dramatically, together could lead to an avoidance of CO2 that is completely
independent of the targeted octopamine neurons.  
  
In this respect it is important to point out that the authors are not trying
to hide this effect. In the text, in what appears to be a contradiction to the
abstract, the authors write:

We note that the _Tdc2-GAL4/+_ driver line does not spend a significantly
greater amount of time in the CO2 plume by comparison to air, but this line,
as well as the _UAS-TNT/+_ parent line, spends significantly more time in the
CO2 plume in comparison to their progeny. Therefore, this experimental result
cannot be fully attributable to the genetic background.

The last sentence, of course, is incorrect: if both lines independently reduce
the attractiveness of CO2, then it is very conceivable, one might even say
straightforward, that both together might reduce it so much, that the
resulting value of CO2 is negative, leading to an aversive response in the
flies, irrespective of the involvement of octopamine.  
  
Given what is known about the action of octopamine in these processes, the
hypotheses that the authors claim to have corroborated is beautiful, makes
sense and is biologically plausible. So the result they present in the
abstract "blocking synaptic output from octopamine neurons inverts the valence
assigned to CO2" makes this a very sexy paper for the field that unites
several disparate findings and puts a whole set of results in a broader
perspective (and may well be correct!). Of course, these considerations are
crucial for marketing your paper to one of the top journals in the field. Had
the authors discarded the octopamine results from their paper, it is highly
unlikely it would have been published in Current Biology.  
  
To be very clear: I can't find any misconduct in this paper, only clever
marketing of the sort that occurs in almost every 'top-journal' paper these
days and is definitely common practice. On the contrary, this is exactly the
behavior incentivized by the current system, it's what the system demands, so
this is what we get. It's precisely this kind of marketing we refer to in our
manuscript, that is selected for in the current
[evolution](http://brembs.net/evolution) of the scientific community. If you
don't do it, you'll end up unemployed.  
  
In this respect it is worth speculating about the particular incentives the
authors of this study might have experienced. The first author is a postdoc in
[Mark Frye's lab](https://www.ibp.ucla.edu/research/frye/mark_a.htm), so she
needs to publish in top journals to get a job. The second author was an
undergraduate, so likely less involved in the drafting and revising of the
paper and the last author is a [junior investigator for
HHMI](http://www.hhmi.org/research/ecs/frye_bio.html), so likely under
enormous pressure (or at least perceived pressure) to publish in top journals
not only to justify his award, but also to do well in future evaluations.  
  
Obviously, this is just a case study, N=1, an anecdote, but I think it
exemplifies the incentives and how they can distort the scientific debate. For
instance, see the Tweet I sent around after I read the abstract (but before I
had a look at the actual data:
