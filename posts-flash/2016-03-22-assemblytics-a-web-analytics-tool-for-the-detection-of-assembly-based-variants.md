> Summary: Assemblytics is a web app for detecting and analyzing structural
variants from a de novo genome assembly aligned to a reference genome. It
incorporates a unique anchor filtering approach to increase robustness to
repetitive elements, and identifies six classes of variants based on their
distinct alignment signatures. Assemblytics can be applied both to comparing
aberrant genomes, such as human cancers, to a reference, or to identify
differences between related species. Multiple interactive visualizations
enable in-depth explorations of the genomic distributions of variants.
