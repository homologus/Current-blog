A month back, we presented a commentary on [Quip, Minia, SlimGene and Titus
Browns paper on Scaling Metagenome](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/2012/07/19
/quip-minia-slimgene-and-titus-browns-paper-on-scaling-metagenome/). We just
[found out](http://kevin-gattaca.blogspot.com/2012/08/pub-compression-of-next-
generation.html) that the Quip paper is out in [Nucleic Acids Research](http:/
/nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2012/08/14/nar.gks754.long).

The authors kindly made their paper available at their website prior to
publication, and [our previous
discussion](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/2012/07/19/quip-minia-slimgene-and-
titus-browns-paper-on-scaling-metagenome/) on the novel aspects of their
approach already covered what is in the paper. On another reading, we found
many other papers cited by them as interesting as well. Especially, we like to
carefully read the following two papers, when we find time.

1\. Fritz MH-Y, Leinonen R, Cochrane G, Birney E. (2011) Efficient storage of
high throughput DNA sequencing data using reference-based compression. Genome
Res.;21:734-740.

2\. Liu Y, Schmidt B, Maskell DL Parallelized short read assembly of large
genomes using de Bruijn graphs. BMC Bioinformatics 2011;12:354.

Our [NGS reference list](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/2012/08/07/building-a
-ngs-reference-list-please-add/) is updated with link to Quip paper.
