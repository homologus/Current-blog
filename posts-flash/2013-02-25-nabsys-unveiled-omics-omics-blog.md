For some 'unknown' reason, when we first saw the picture of an instrument in
Omics! Omics! blog on Friday, we thought it was a practical joke on another
sequencing company bearing the name of a revered British university. We tried
hard to uncover the hidden sarcastic 'tone' in his two long commentaries
starting with this paragraph.

> A complaint which seems to be circulating on Twitter and elsewhere is that
this years AGBT conference on Marco Island next week doesnt look like it will
have any excitement around new platforms. AGBT has been a traditional coming
out party for platforms. Last year it was Oxford Nanopore which created a huge
buzz, and in previous years that crown has been held by Ion Torrent, Pacific
Biosciences, Complete Genomics and others (including a few which seem to have
gone kaput).

After wrongly interpreting two and a half paragraphs, we realized that Keith
was talking about a real instrument going into beta test soon. For the time
being, primary goal of Nabsys' instrument is to do Positional Sequencing,
which really means precisely measuring the distance between predictable
landmarks on DNA." For more details, please take a look at two excellent
commentaries from Omics! Omics! blog.
