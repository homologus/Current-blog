I think mathematicians and physicists are most likely to lead us to future of
publishing, because their research does not get showered with NIH money.
Therefore, they have to make sure every extra money they spend on publishing
and other communication aspects is absolutely necessary. High-energy
physicists adopted arxiv in the 1990s after they lost a bunch of funding due
to end of cold war.

[Discrete Analysis an arXiv overlay
journal](https://gowers.wordpress.com/2015/09/10/discrete-analysis-an-arxiv-
overlay-journal/) (h/t: @lpachter)

> This post is to announce the start of a new mathematics journal, to be
called Discrete Analysis. While in most respects it will be just like any
other journal, it will be unusual in one important way: it will be purely an
arXiv overlay journal. That is, rather than publishing, or even electronically
hosting, papers, it will consist of a list of links to arXiv preprints. Other
than that, the journal will be entirely conventional: authors will submit
links to arXiv preprints, and then the editors of the journal will find
referees, using their quick opinions and more detailed reports in the usual
way in order to decide which papers will be accepted.

Part of the motivation for starting the journal is, of course, to challenge
existing models of academic publishing and to contribute in a small way to
creating an alternative and much cheaper system. However, I hope that in due
course people will get used to this publication model, at which point the fact
that Discrete Analysis is an arXiv overlay journal will no longer seem
interesting or novel, and the main interest in the journal will be the
mathematics it contains.
