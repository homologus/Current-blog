One 'genuine' 8kb Oxford Nanopore read showed up, creating big buzz over
twitter chat channels -

[A P. aeruginosa serotype-defining single read from our first Oxford Nanopore 
run](http://figshare.com/articles/A_P_aeruginosa_serotype_defining_single_read
_from_our_first_Oxford_Nanopore_run/1052996)

Lex Nederbragt posted an alignment with the genome -

How good is it? Heng Li thinks it is visually not too different from PacBio
alignments, but others disagree.

Hopefully, by the end of this year, more than 50 nanopore reads will trickle
in so that one can start addressing this issue. By then, this curve will cross
Kim Kardashian's wedding tweets.

Edit.

Why quote over genuine?

Nick Loman also posted the electrical signal for his read -

you want to download the read and analyze yourself.
