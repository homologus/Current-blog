[SETI@home](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SETI@home) projects at various
planets within and outside Milky Way will get busy with a new 'big data'
puzzle, because this year's Burning Man show plans to ship them the genomes of
genomics pioneer Jonathan Rothberg and many others using laser. (h/t:

Quoting from the article in Wired magazine:

"Genome started as a wild idea I had a couple of days after getting engaged in
February," cocreator Housley told Wired.co.uk. "I briefly mentioned the idea
in a long email to my fiances uncle, Dr Jonathan Rothberg, who developed high
speed genome sequencing, moved it to a 'chip'; and can sequence a person in a
few hours now with new machines. Jonathan's response was 'love the laser
idea'. So I started exploring it further."

It's handy having a genome sequencing expert in the family, and it's Rothberg
who will be sequencing the genome of anyone who contributes enough to the
campaign (it's the perk of a $1,500 [975] donation). Rothberg sequenced the
genome of James Watson, the codiscoverer of the DNA double helix who helped
establish the Human Genome Project, and also launched the Neanderthal Genome
Project. In recognition of this work, Rothberg's genome will be projected in
the light display first.

Pretty cool, hah? [More details at
