or how about a communist, a capitalist and an industrialist enter into a bar?
<!--more-->

Dear readers, we have not started drinking early. Our lighter mood is caused
by a paragraph from Nature news story titled '[Geneticists Push for Global
Data-sharing'](http://www.nature.com/news/geneticists-push-for-global-data-
sharing-1.13133).

> The effort has gained support from some of the worlds most influential
sequence-data holders, including the NIH, the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute
in Hinxton, UK, and the BGI (formerly the Beijing Genomics Institute) in
Shenzhen, China.

Although we have very little insight on sharing of data (or beer for that
matter), we have not failed to notice that the 'capitalists' are represented
by the government and the 'communists' are represented by a successful
business.

Is this a joke?
