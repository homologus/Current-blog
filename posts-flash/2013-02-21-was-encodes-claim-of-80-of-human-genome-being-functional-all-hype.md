An interesting paper titled [On the Immortality of Television Sets: Function
in the Human Genome According to the Evolution-free Gospel of ENCODE](http://g
be.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2013/02/20/gbe.evt028.full.pdf+html) came
out in Genome Biology. Two sentences of abstract should tell you what it is
all about.

The ENCODE results were predicted by one of its authors to necessitate the
rewriting of textbooks. We agree, many textbooks dealing with marketing, mass-
media hype, and public relations may well have to be rewritten.

We have not got a chance to go through the paper, but one name in the author's
list suggests that we should. Eran Elhaik was the author of a controversial
study we posted few days back.

[New Study Sheds Light on the Origin of the European Jewish
Population](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/2013/01/22/new-study-sheds-light-on-
the-origin-of-the-european-jewish-population/)

Prior to posting that commentary, we searched through [Haldane's
Sieve](http://haldanessieve.org/) blog, which covers unusual arxiv-posted
preprints on population biology. After not finding anything on Dr. Elhaik's
paper, we asked for opinion from one of the authors of Haldane's Sieve and did
not get any response. That forced us to do the hard work of going through both
the original study of [Behar et
al.](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v466/n7303/abs/nature09103.html) and
Elhaik's revised analysis and figure out who was correct. We found Dr.
Elhaik's numerical methods to be more accurate and they clearly backed his
conclusions. Since then, we corresponded heavily over email with Dr. Elhaik
and found him to be an excellent scientist.

All those do not necessarily make his ENCODE-related paper correct, but we
will hold the judgement until we manage to read it carefully. Here is the full
abstract -

A recent slew of ENCODE Consortium publications, specifically the article
signed by all Consortium members, put forward the idea that more than 80% of
the human genome is functional. This claim flies in the face of current
estimates according to which the fraction of the genome that is evolutionarily
conserved through purifying selection is under 10%. Thus, according to the
ENCODE Consortium, a biological function can be maintained indefinitely
without selection, which implies that at least 80 10 = 70% of the genome is
perfectly invulnerable to deleterious mutations, either because no mutation
can ever occur in these functional regions, or because no mutation in these
regions can ever be deleterious. This absurd conclusion was reached through
various means, chiefly (1) by employing the seldom used causal role definition
of biological function and then applying it inconsistently to different
biochemical properties, (2) by committing a logical fallacy known as affirming
the consequent, (3) by failing to appreciate the crucial difference between
junk DNA and garbage DNA, (4) by using analytical methods that yield biased
errors and inflate estimates of functionality, (5) by favoring statistical
sensitivity over specificity, and (6) by emphasizing statistical significance
rather than the magnitude of the effect. Here, we detail the many logical and
methodological transgressions involved in assigning functionality to almost
every nucleotide in the human genome. The ENCODE results were predicted by one
of its authors to necessitate the rewriting of textbooks. We agree, many
textbooks dealing with marketing, mass-media hype, and public relations may
well have to be rewritten.
