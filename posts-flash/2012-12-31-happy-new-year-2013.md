The above Bengali song is written by
[Tagore](http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1913
/tagore-bio.html), who got Nobel prize in literature exactly hundred years

friends from the past.

Speaking of remembering the past, please do not forget to submit your
suggestions for [Top Bioinformatics Developments of

innovations-of-2012-contest/). It will be a good opportunity for us to learn,
what important applications we may have missed and can cover them in 2013.
