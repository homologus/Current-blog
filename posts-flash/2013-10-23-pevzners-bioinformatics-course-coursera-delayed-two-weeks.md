[Syllabus](https://beta.stepic.org/media/attachments/lessons/1/Coursera%20Syll
abus.pdf) surely looks interesting and the week 1 version is shown below. By
some strange coincidence, when we first dipped our toes into bioinformatics
(mostly by working on papers), we also looked into the problem of DNA
replication origin first.
