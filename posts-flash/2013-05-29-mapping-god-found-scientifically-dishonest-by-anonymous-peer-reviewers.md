The whole process of sales and marketing of papers (also known as 'peer
reviewed publication') is so broken in biology that one can only laugh by
watching the [devolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devolution_\(biology\))
of the system. We noticed the problem as soon as we started submitting papers
in this field. One of our friends always had better luck than us in getting
his papers accepted for review process at Science and he even managed to get
one of our 'do not like to review, because not interesting for our great
journal' paper go through the review process. Being curious ([a 17th century
practice](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/blog/2013/05/20/philip-ball-on-how-
scientists-stopped-being-curious/)), we checked how he did it, and discovered
that he always started his conversation with Science editors with 'I am the
student of Nobel Laureate so and so'.

That method works very well, as found out by [a study of papers published in
top psychology journals](http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract;
jsessionid=60D33B664B8565377C047087589E3D66.journals?fromPage=online&aid=65778
44). h/t: @DanGraur

> The present investigation was an attempt to study the peer-review process
directly, in the natural setting of actual journal referee evaluations of
submitted manuscripts. As test materials we selected 12 already published
research articles by investigators from prestigious and highly productive
American psychology departments, one article from each of 12 highly regarded
and widely read American psychology journals with high rejection rates (80%)
and nonblind refereeing practices.

With fictitious names and institutions substituted for the original ones
(e.g., Tri-Valley Center for Human Potential), the altered manuscripts were
formally resubmitted to the journals that had originally refereed and
published them 18 to 32 months earlier. Of the sample of 38 editors and
reviewers, only three (8%) detected the resubmissions. This result allowed
nine of the 12 articles to continue through the review process to receive an
actual evaluation: eight of the nine were rejected. Sixteen of the 18 referees
(89%) recommended against publication and the editors concurred. The grounds
for rejection were in many cases described as serious methodological flaws. A
number of possible interpretations of these data are reviewed and evaluated.

With that background, let us get to the main story. We just learned that [Heng
Li's BWA-Mem paper](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/blog/2013/05/27/bwa-mem-heng-
lis-answer-to-bowtie2/) [got rejected by a
journal](https://gist.github.com/ctb/5663625).

Hi bwa users,

The bwa-mem manuscript has been rejected. Interestingly, the first reviewer
only raised a couple of minor concerns and then accepted the manuscript in the
second round of the review. The second reviewer made quite a few mistakes on
some basic concepts and was hostile from the beginning. The third reviewer
gave fair and good review in the first round, all of which have been
addressed, but he then tried hard to argue one particular mapper to be the
best in accuracy that on the contrary is inferior to most others in my view. I
admit that my responses were not appropriate, either, when I was in rage under
the charge of being "scientifically dishonest" - because I did not show that
particular mapper in the main figure given its absence of mapping quality.

Anyway, this is the past and you cannot really tell if I am the biased one
when myself is describing the review process. As to the manuscript, I do not
have plan to submit it to another peer-reviewed journal before I get time from
the problems that interest me more. The manuscript is fairly short and simple.
It should not be hard for you to judge how bwa-mem is compared to those peer-
reviewed mappers. If you decide to use bwa-mem, please cite:

"Li H. (2013) Aligning sequence reads, clone sequences and assembly contigs
with BWA-MEM. arXiv:1303.3997v1 [q-bio.GN]."

I would greatly appreciate. In these years, I sometimes did not pay enough
attention to users' requests and sometimes even lost patience in answering
questions. I deeply apologize for these. Just remember: when I calm down, I am
always grateful to every user, really.

Thank you very much,

Heng

PS: I regard this review process as an isolated event. I don't mean to
criticize the journal or the peer-review process in general with this example.
As I said, I was not doing everything in the best way, either.

Here are the problems with the objections of the reviewers, and moreover the
big picture of existing approach to publish in so-called peer reviewed
journals.

1\. Heng Li has a large electronic footprint, which is one's real 'publication
record' in the internet era. Anyone, who reads [Heng Li's comments at
Biostars](http://www.biostars.org/u/795/) or Seqanswers, knows that he tries
to do very thorough job. So, throwing big words like 'scientifically
dishonest' disgraces the peer review process rather than saying anything about
the quality of his submitted work.

2\. Only reason for his sending the paper to a traditional journal is possibly
to be able to fill up 'publication' column in grant review, because the
github, biostars, seqanswers, blogs and arxiv are not considered as
'publications' by NIH.

3\. Even the [mapping God](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/blog/2013/02/20/the-
mapping-god-speaketh/) can be wrong, as he surely is in the last part of his
comment :)

> I regard this review process as an isolated event. I don't mean to criticize
the journal or the peer-review process in general with this example.

The does not agree with the mentioned study on psychology papers in the top
part of the commentary. Unless Heng Li revises the last part of his opinion,
we will start calling him all kinds of nasty names like reviewer 3.
