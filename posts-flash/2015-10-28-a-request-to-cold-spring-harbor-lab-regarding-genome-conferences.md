title: A Request to Cold Spring Harbor Lab Regarding 'Genome' Conferences

Cold Spring Harbor lab has been the premier research center in biological
sciences. Sadly, it is making mistakes in recent years, and those mistakes
will hurt the organization, if not started to hurt already.

Thankfully the research center still has intelligent people. For example,
three years back, I wrote a letter to the editor of Genome Research requesting
to allow arxiv preprint submission, and my letter was supported by a number of
other bioinformaticians. CSHL not only understood the point and changed its
previous position on Genome Research, but also spearheaded the effort to start
biorxiv preprint server for biology. Hopefully this letter will reach some of
those cool heads.

We are sad to find that the Cold Spring Harbor lab conferences have been taken
over by clowns. Such conferences usually have the name 'genome', but rarely
acknowledge any leading discoveries related to genomes, informatics or biology
of genomes. We previously wrote about the 'Biology of Genomes' conferences,
where only those connected to ENCODE project got to speak. Afterward a number
of leading researchers sent us private emails agreeing with what we said. They
were not undergrads or grad students, but directors of labs or higher. More
importantly, they published papers with major discoveries. Fast forward by 2-3
years, they all moved on to different conferences and told us that they see no
value in going to 'Biology of Genomes' at CSHL. Another collaborator of us (a
graduate student), went to one of the CSHL conferences organized by ENCODE
clown John Stamatoyannopoulos and was very disappointed.

We are currently monitoring the ['Genome Informatics' 2015
conference](https://meetings.cshl.edu/meetings.aspx?meet=info&year=15), and
are sad to find that CSHL is damaging itself in the same manner. We made some
of those points in [our previous
commentary](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/blog/2015/10/27/talks-and-posters-at-
the-genome-informatics-conference/), and Dr. Gholson Lyon from CSHL commented
about our post in twitter.

The most important point from our post, that he did not mention, is that the
talks are not based on merit any more. For example, the biggest contribution
to informatics last year was [the algorithmic idea of
minimizer](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/blog/2014/04/06/2014-the-year-of-
minimizers-in-bioinformatics/). It has been adopted in KMC making it the
fastest k-mer counter. It has been adopted in genome assembly by Rayan Chikhi
to build an ultra-low RAM assembler (~1GB for human genome). It was used by
Derrick Wood and Steven Salzberg to create Kraken, an ultrafast metagenome
search program. Minimizer is now being used by Heng Li to build an extremely
efficient aligner - minimap. The concept of minimizer has been revolutionary
to anyone, who is seriously doing informatics.

The idea originated from James Yorke in 2004, and therefore we expected him to
give a keynote speech at this informatics conference. After all, 2014 had been
the year, when his concept got recognized by the scientific community.
Instead, we find the same boring Mark Gerstein as keynote speaker. Gerstein
was an ENCODE leader, [who blew up big
time](http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2013/02/20/gbe.evt028) and
had been unapologetic about it.

Let's go to the biology and medicine side. Where are the people like [Bill
Martin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_F._Martin), who are using
informatics to answer real biological questions? In contrast "Personal and
Medical Genomics" has very little to report apart from hype. Yet the
conference has "Discussion leaders" in the later category, but not in former
(biochemistry/biology).

On the technology side, what is the explanation of having three talks on
Oxford Nanopore apart from connections? Not only the technology is immature,
no new informatics discovery came from this community. Most ideas were
borrowed from those working on Pacbio.

We understand that these conferences have become big business for CSHL, but
promoting clowns has not made many businesses successful. CSHL should get rid
of the current organizers, and rethink its strategy about these conferences
with more serious researchers on board.
