Steve McIntyre of Climate Audit blog [pointed out an interesting
anomaly](http://climateaudit.org/2013/03/14/no-uptick-in-marcott-thesis/) in a
recent Science paper published by researchers from OSU and Harvard.

The Science paper titled [A Reconstruction of Regional and Global Temperature
for the Past 11,300 Years](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/339/6124/1198.abs
tract?sid=8966f73c-8880-4d66-81cc-6f22c89c01a1) has the following figure.

However, when readers check the corresponding figure from [PhD thesis of first
author](http://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/1957/21129/Ma
rcottShaunA2011.pdf?sequence=2), they find something completely different -

Another pair of figures show similar discrepancy between Science version and
thesis version. What is going on? Is it worth investing $20 to purchase the
Science paper and take a closer look? Supplementary materials, where all dead
bodies get hidden, [are freely available
