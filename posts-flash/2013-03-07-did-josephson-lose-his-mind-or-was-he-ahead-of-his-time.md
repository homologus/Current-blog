[Edit. Professor Josephson was kind enough to send us an email with
corrections on few points. We incorporated them in the text with markings as
'Corrections'.]

Few days back, we wrote about ['sixth sense' in
nature](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/2013/03/01/sixth-sense-in-vertebrates/),
and it reminded us of Brian Josephson, who had been rejected by mainstream
physics community as 'voodoo scientist' for a while.

As graduate students working on superconductivity, we came to know about the
fascinating life of Brian Josephson. When he submitted his [Nobel-prize
winning](http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1973
/josephson-cv.html) paper in 1962, he was only 22 years old. Our physicist
friends told us that the paper got rejected by Physical Review, the top
journal in physics, because [John
Bardeen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bardeen) did not think it was
correct. After all, who would an editor agree with, a two time physics Nobel
prize winner, who discovered superconductivity theory, or a 22 year old
graduate student? However, based on P. W. Anderson's essay linked below, the
paper was intentionally submitted to the first volume of a new journal (Phys.
Lett. 1, 252, 1962), because even Josephson could not believe what it
suggested. [**Correction.** _Paper was never submitted to PRB or PRL, because
his advisor Brian Pippard wanted to support new European journal Physics
Letters. Bardeen seemed to have criticized the work afterward. The decision of
journal was not influenced by novel approach or results._]

We also heard from physicists that Josephson could do the work because of
influence from his mentor Anderson, a leading condensed matter physicist of
the era. That notion had been corrected by Anderson in his beautiful essay -
[How Josephson Discovered his Effect](http://ist-socrates.berkeley.edu/~phylab
s/adv/ReprintsPDF/JOS%20Reprints/05%20-%20How%20Josephson%20Discovered%20his%2
0Effect.pdf) that is highly worth reading. [**Correction.** _Brian Pippard was
his advisor, not Anderson. Anderson was visiting Cambridge at the time._]

Today's commentary is not about superconductivity, but about what Josephson
did afterward. In 1995, a post-doctoral student working with us told me that
he 'simply lost his mind'. That was what all physicists believed, because
Josephson never published any more paper in traditional physics journals and
there was no media outlet to learn about his research projects. Thanks to the
internet, readers can now learn about his 'after life' from his own website.
Few snippets are presented below.

[**Correction.** _Professor Josephson did publish in refereed journal
Foundations of Physics subsequent to his shift in interests, and our readers
may find them very interesting._

[Limits to the Universitality of Quantum
Mechanics](http://www.tcm.phy.cam.ac.uk/~bdj10/papers/QMlimits.html)

[Biological Utilisation of Quantum
NonLocality](http://www.tcm.phy.cam.ac.uk/~bdj10/papers/bell.html)]

**Criticism of arxix.org**

While many biologists are now turning to arxiv preprint server as something
new, Josephson pointed out that arxiv.org was not a proper venue for
publishing out-of-the-norm results, because its [administrators deleted papers
they did not agree with](http://www.tcm.phy.cam.ac.uk/~bdj10/).

>

Unusually, the administrators of the physics archive at arXiv.org rapidly
deleted a paper successfully deposited in the archive, perhaps as a reflex
response to the fact that the paper concerned reviewed research in cold
fusion. As a service to the scientific community, this 37-page review by
Edmund Storms is being made available on this web site. It is suggested that
serious scientific comments on the review, by those registered for depositing
papers in the archive, be deposited in the cond-mat section, with crosslinking
to nucl-ex and a link to the original review (here). However, there can be no
guarantee that such contributions will not be deleted from the archive as was
the review itself.

**Physics of Brain, telepathy and paranormal**

Now that so many people are getting interested in brain and neural circuit
mapping, the following talk by Josephson could be worth listening to.

[Josephson's website](http://www.tcm.phy.cam.ac.uk/~bdj10/) has many other
nuggets of unusual thinking that readers will enjoy.
