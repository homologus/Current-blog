> Bacteriophages (phages) infect bacteria in order to replicate and burst out
of the host, killing the cell, when reproduction is completed. Thus, from a
bacterial perspective, phages pose a persistent lethal threat to bacterial
populations. Not surprisingly, bacteria evolved multiple defense barriers to
interfere with nearly every step of phage life cycles. Phages respond to this
selection pressure by counter-evolving their genomes to evade

bacterial resistance. The antagonistic interaction between bacteria and
rapidly diversifying viruses promotes the evolution and dissemination of
bacteriophage-resistance mechanisms in bacteria. Recently, an adaptive
microbial immune system, named clustered regularly interspaced short
palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and which provides acquired immunity against
viruses and plasmids, has been identified. Unlike the restrictionmodification
anti-phage barrier that subjects to cleavage any foreign DNA lacking a
protective methyl-tag in the target site, the CRISPR Cas systems are invader-
specific, adaptive, and heritable. In this review, we focus on the molecular
mechanisms of interference/immunity provided by different CRISPRCas systems.
