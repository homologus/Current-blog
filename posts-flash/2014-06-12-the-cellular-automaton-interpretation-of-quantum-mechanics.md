We have been trying to catch up with the latest discoveries in mathematics and
theoretical physics, and a provocative arxiv paper caught our attention (h/t:
@infoecho). It is written by Gerard 't Hooft, who has done outstanding work in
theoretical physics.

[The Cellular Automaton Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics - A View on the
Quantum Nature of our Universe, Compulsory or
Impossible?](http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.1548)

> When investigating theories at the tiniest conceivable scales in nature,
"quantum logic" is taking over from "classical logic" in the minds of almost
all researchers today. Dissatisfied, the author investigated how one can look
at things differently. This report is an overview of older material, but also
contains many new observations and calculations. Quantum mechanics is looked
upon as a tool, not as a theory. Examples are displayed of models that are
classical in essence, but can be analysed by the use of quantum techniques,
and we argue that even the Standard Model, together with gravitational
interactions, may be viewed as a quantum mechanical approach to analyse a
system that could be classical at its core. We then explain how these
apparently heretic thoughts can be reconciled with Bell's theorem and the
usual objections voiced against the notion of 'super determinism'. Our
proposal would eradicate the collapse problem and the measurement problem.

We previously wrote about fractals and cellular automata
([here](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/blog/2013/10/28/fractals-scale-free-
networks/) and [here](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/blog/2013/11/20/new-kind-
science/)), and are very interested in the topic. The paper linked above will
be at the top of our must-read stack and we will comment again, if we make any
progress in understanding it.
