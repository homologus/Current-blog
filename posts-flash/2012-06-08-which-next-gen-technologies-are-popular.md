Many different next generation sequencing technologies have been developed
over the last few years. We were curious about which were being actively used
by large number of NGS enthusiasts. After months and months of extensive
research and writing lengthy equations, we derived a formula that we believe
reasonably reflects the relative usage. 'Complete' in the chart gives the
number for technology from 'Complete Genomics'.

Ok, that part about lengthy equations and extensive research is a joke. The
above estimates are as unscientific as they could be. So, please take them
with a grain of salt.

P. S. The above chart is generated using R.

for those interested in using R for generating various charts.
