Regular readers know that we are not only big supporters of open-access
publication and arxiv.org, we see them as [natural outcomes due to progress in
communication technology](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/2012/08/06/nature-
journal-recognizes-arxiv-org-reaches-its-own-wile-e-coyote-moment/). In fact
most traditional journals are still surviving because of help from [dinosaurs
otherwise known as funding agencies](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/2013/01/05
/nature-vs-steven-salzbeg-who-is-right/), who give more priority to one form
of publication (paper) than others (software, database, website, blog,
twitter, seqanswers).

Two months back, we learned about Gigascience from a colleague and liked their
'zero publication charge' model. They are also trying to push the boundary in
other ways, and the following commentary, cross-posted with permission from
[Scott Edmunds' blog at
Gigascience](http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/gigablog/2012/12/27/opening-peer-
review-our-new-paper-on-soapdenovo2-shows-how-it-works/), explains how.
