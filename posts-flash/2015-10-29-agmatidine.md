> Agmatidine (2-agmatinylcytidine, symbol C+ or agm2C) is a modified cytidine
present in the wobble position of the anticodon of several archaeal AUA
decoding tRNAs. Agmatidine is essential for correct decoding of the AUA codon
in many archaea and is required for aminoacylation of tRNAIle2 with
isoleucine.

> The role of the agmatidine and lysidine modifications in isoleucine decoding
is a notable example of the essential function of modifications in tRNA and,
more generally, in RNA biology. It is increasingly evident that although the
genetic code was first elucidated over 40 years ago, we are just beginning to
appreciate the sheer complexity of ensuring accuracy in protein synthesis on
the ribosome.
