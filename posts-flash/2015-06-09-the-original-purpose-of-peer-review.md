After Pachter's tarring and feathering of [bioinformatics 'leaders' Manolis
Kellis and Eric
Lander](https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2015/05/26/pachters-p-value-prize/),
many researchers are talking about the value of 'post-publication peer review'
(see comments [here](https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2015/06/09/i-was-
wrong/#comments) or at the [Eisen's
blog](http://www.michaeleisen.org/blog/?p=1718)). I find those comments
misguided, because peer review was never meant to be similar to a professor
grading student's homework. Real peers always judged papers after publication
and at times many years after.

The original system was built a long time back, when scientists followed a
different culture. I left the world of theoretical physics years ago, and back
in those days the physicists cared a lot about reputation. Reputation was like
a currency they carried, and it increased or decreased based on the quality of
publications. The funding system was peripheral to reputation. An University
wanted to hire reputed scientists, no matter how little money he brought to
the organization. A system close to that is still followed in mathematics,
where most would find [Grigori
Perelman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grigori_Perelman) as a reputed
mathematician.

In those days, the reputation currencies could be lost very easily by poor
publications (or misconduct, which was very rare). My professor often
mentioned about something like a 'two strikes' rule. He said that the physics
community would excuse someone's first incorrect paper, but if the same
researcher published another low-quality paper **in her career**, he would be
filing for 'reputational bankruptcy'. That makes sense in the real world. If I
announced about proving Fermat's last theorem in 1990 and Poincare conjecture
in 1991, and both of those proofs were wrong, I doubt any mathematician would
have cared to hear my 1992 announcement. Sadly, the bioinformaticians do not
treat Kellis and Birney in the same way, and not doing so would in turn
disrepute the entire field of bioinformatics.

In the old system, the role of peer review was to help fellow scientists catch
obvious errors before the paper went on print so that they did not lose
reputation. However, ultimately the full responsibility rested on the
author(s) of the paper. To be doubly sure about not making mistake in a proof,
we often circulated the preprints among friendly scientists prior to
submission (friendly defined by one who wont scoop my results), and that
preprint circulation system morphed into the physics arxiv in early 90s, when
I was a graduate student.

Why doesn't reputation matter any more? The answer is hugely expanded role of
NIH. It is encouraging that Dan Graur and I come to find the [same
reason](http://judgestarling.tumblr.com/post/120959594801/evolution-free-
genomics-a-1964-paper-as-a-prelude) for destruction of an effective scientific
culture.

> My only explanation for their continuing existence is that the wannabe
ignoramuses, self-promoting bureaucrats, and ol fashion crooks of ENCODE are
protected from criticism and penalties for cheating by the
[person](http://judgestarling.tumblr.com/post/97259387131/eric-green-funding-
authorship-integrity-and-an) who gives them the money. Thus, they can continue
to take as much money from the public as their pockets would hold, and in
return they will continue to produce large piles of excrement that are
hungrily consumed by [gullible journalists](http://news.sciencemag.org/author
/elizabeth-pennisi) who double as Science editors.

Therefore, the only way to begin fixing the system would be to shut down NHGRI
and send Eric Green home. All other changes, including [the stupid DORA
pledge](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/blog/2013/06/12/dora-pledge-yasi-from-
government-funded-scientists/), [post-publication peer
review](rpachter.wordpress.com/2015/05/26/pachters-p-value-prize/), etc. are
ineffective attempts to fix the symptoms without attacking the real problem.

Despite above appeals, I do not personally believe the mainstream science in
USA can be fixed. The system is heading into collapse, because the crooks with
vested interest captured the system and have no interest in fixes going
against their interests. One can see many similarities with the banking system
prior to 2008 breakdown, and interestingly many 'outside' blogs that pointed
out the banking problems in 2007-2008 are [starting to do the same for
mainstream science in 2015](http://thearchdruidreport.blogspot.com/2015/06
/the-era-of-breakdown.html). The following comment was posted in the linked
blog post -

> Very enjoyable. As a molecular biologist, your paragraph about science
particularly hit home.

It is hard to convey how wasteful and useless a lot of scientific work is to
people outside the field. The 3 main requirements for successful career
scientists - to publish, publish, and publish - do not select for careful or
thoughtful inquiry. The day-to-day process of science as I have observed in
multiple institutions is so wasteful of reagents and consumables that it would
shock you. We scientists sit at the top of a pyramid, demanding raw materials
and factories and specialised chemical manufacturies and chemical processing
plants, and it is noticeable how swiftly the costs of research have increased
as every step of that pyramid suddenly gains additional costs as scarcity of
raw materials and costs of transportation increases. The companies supplying
the biomedical field merge or go quietly bust, remove seemingly profitable
product lines without explanation, and yet few of my peers seem to recognise
or acknowledge the underlying processes at work.

I once sat in a conference and listened to a giant of my field talk of what
she saw as the future of research - more and bigger sequencing projects! It is
not enough to sequence a single cancer to inform a patients treatment(in
theory) - 10 clones, 50 clones, 100 clones can be sequenced! The faint echo
you hear is the heavily diminishing return in such an egregious waste of
resources. There are genetic diseases caused by single gene disorders
discovered in the 80s which have no viable treatment - we know exactly why
they occur, but not how to change them back to health without making things
worse.

Do not look to any scientist in the hope of saving the current status quo -
science is great at converting grant funding into mortgage payments, and
coffee into published papers - but it is largely yet another shell game like
fracking, albeit one which at least has a chance of VERY occasionally
discovering something "useful" - usually something hideously expensive to
produce, and of some small measureable benefit at a population level. The
truth is, the money spent on that wonder drug to give you 6 more months of
life would probably been better spent helping ten or a hundred people survive,
ie. using an ad campaign telling you to check any odd looking moles out with
your GP. But one is 'progress' and 'r and d spending' and can build someone's
career, and the other isn't, and doesn't.

I continue to convert my own wage into resilient personal skills. Thank you
for your blog, it has helped.
