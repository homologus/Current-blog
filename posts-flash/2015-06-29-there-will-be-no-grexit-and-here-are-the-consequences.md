Most people still cannot wrap their head around what is going on in Greece and
how it will affect their lives. Let me summarize that for you, but not before
you get an intro on the banking system.

**Banking System Fact 1. **

(Physical) cash is the core of the banking system. The electronic money people
see in their bank accounts is a derivative of that cash. It may or may not be
converted into physical cash, when you ask for it.

**Banking System Fact 2.**

The total amount of physical cash in the banking system is limited. The
situation is similar to gold in the 1930s. Yes, it is true that the
governments can print banknotes, but they are restricted by the banks to not
do so.

**Banking System Fact 3.**

The worldwide banking system is going to blow up due to lack of collateral and
the world is going cash only. You can see that process by following the events
in Greece over the last few years. In a cash-only regime, very little
electronic cash will be accepted anywhere, because a person/business accepting
electronic money will be taking the risk of being locked within a bank holiday
somewhere.

\-------------------

Based on above the three facts, can you tell me the people of which country in
Europe have the highest amount of cash right now? Then after the blow up, who
will be the most ahead?

In 1930s analogy, Greeks ran away with Europe's 'gold' and that was the main
purpose of this drip-drip-drip bank run over the last six months funded by
ECB. Do not underestimate Varoufakis.
