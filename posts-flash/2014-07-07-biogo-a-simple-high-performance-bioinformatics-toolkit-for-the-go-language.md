We noticed earlier about GO language - ["Why are Cool Kids at Github Moving to
GO Language?"](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/blog/2014/01/16/golang/)

Now Kortschak and Adelson [posted a biorxiv
paper](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2014/05/12/005033?rss=1) about their
framework to help bioinformaticians integrate GO in their work.

> bogo is a framework designed to ease development and maintenance of
computationally intensive bioinformatics applications. The library is written
in the Go programming language, a garbage-collected, strictly typed compiled
language with built in support for concurrent processing, and performance
comparable to C and Java. It provides a variety of data types and utility
functions to facilitate manipulation and analysis of large scale genomic and
other biological data. bogo uses a concise and expressive syntax, lowering the
barriers to entry for researchers needing to process large data sets with
custom analyses while retaining computational safety and ease of code review.
We believe bogo provides an excellent environment for training and research in
computational biology because of its combination of strict typing, simple and
expressive syntax, and high performance.
