Today is an assembler day !! Sebastien Boisvert notified us that his paper on
using Ray assembler on metagenomes is now available from [Genome Biology
website](http://genomebiology.com/2012/13/12/R122/abstract). We heard [raving
praise of Ray Meta from C. Titus
Brown](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/2012/09/20/a-comment-from-developer-of-ray-
assembler/), and therefore are eager to go through the paper.

> I am a reviewer of the Ray Meta paper and I was very impressed with the
results they reported (yes, I signed my review, so this shouldnt come as a
surprise to them).

Here is the abstract of Ray Meta paper from Genome Biology:

> Voluminous parallel sequencing datasets, especially metagenomic experiments,
require distributed computing for de novo assembly and taxonomic profiling.
Ray Meta is a massively distributed metagenome assembler that is coupled with
Ray Communities, which profiles microbiomes based on uniquely-colored k-mers.
It can accurately assemble and profile a three billion read metagenomic
experiment representing 1,000 bacterial genomes of uneven proportions in 15
hours with 1,024 processor cores, using only 1.5 GB per core. The software
will facilitate the processing of large and complex datasets, and will help in
generating biological insights on specific environments. Ray Meta is open
source and available at http://denovoassembler.sf.net.
