Here is a challenge. Guess the author's name before looking at this new
[arxiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.06047) paper.

> Because genomes are products of natural processes rather than intelligent
design, all genomes contain functional and nonfunctional parts. The fraction
of the genome that has no biological function is called rubbish DNA. Rubbish
DNA consists of junk DNA, i.e., the fraction of the genome on which selection
does not operate, and garbage DNA, i.e., sequences that lower the fitness of
the organism, but exist in the genome because purifying selection is neither
omnipotent nor instantaneous. In this chapter, I (1) review the concepts of
genomic function and functionlessness from an evolutionary perspective, (2)
present a precise nomenclature of genomic function, (3) discuss the evidence
for the existence of vast quantities of junk DNA within the human genome, (4)
discuss the mutational mechanisms responsible for generating junk DNA, (5)
spell out the necessary evolutionary conditions for maintaining junk DNA, (6)
outline various methodologies for estimating the functional fraction within
the genome, and (7) present a recent estimate for the functional fraction of
our genome.
