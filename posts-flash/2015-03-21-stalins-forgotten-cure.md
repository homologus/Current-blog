> TBILISI: Last December, three woodsmen in the mountains of Georgia stumbled
upon a pair of canisters that were, oddly, hot to the touch. The men lugged
the objects back to their campsite to warm themselves on a bitterly cold
night. That turned out to be a terrible mistake: The canisters, Soviet relics
once used to power remote generators, were intensely radioactive and burned
two of the men severely. The victims were rushed to the capital, Tbilisi,
where doctors plied them with antibiotics but failed to prevent staphylococcus
bacteria from invading the deep wounds. Septic shock seemed just around the
corner. Then a kinder legacy of the Soviet Union came to the rescue.
