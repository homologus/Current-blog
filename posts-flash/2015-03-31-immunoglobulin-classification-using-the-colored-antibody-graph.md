> The somatic recombination of V, D, and J gene-segments in B-cells,
introduces a great deal of diversity, and divergence from reference segments.
Many recent studies of antibodies focus on the population of antibody
transcripts that show which V, D, and J gene-segments have been favored for a
particular antigen, a repertoire. To properly describe the antibody
repertoire, each antibody must be labeled by its constituting V, D, and J
gene-segment, a task made difficult by somatic recombination and hypermutation
events. While previous approaches to repertoire analysis were based on
sequential alignments, we describe a new de Bruijn graph based algorithm to
perform VDJ labeling, and benchmark its performance.
