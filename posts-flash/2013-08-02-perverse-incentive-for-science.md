Mike White brought to our attention this thought-provoking Nature Comment by
Paula Stephan that argued how [increased government funding damages
science](http://www2.gsu.edu/~ecopes/Stephan.nature.pdf). We have been very
familiar with most of the points mentioned there, they may come as a surprise
to you. So, we would recommend you to read the entire article [available
here](http://www2.gsu.edu/~ecopes/Stephan.nature.pdf).

The following part surprised us !

> Universities are also driven by incentives. By hiring faculty members on
soft money, with grants providing the salary, the institutions bear almost
none of the risks. Furthermore, universities prefer to put up a new building
or invest millions in remodelling existing lab space rather than house
scientists in older buildings that they already own. Why? One reason is that
debt can be an accounting asset. A US government accounting rule called A21
means that the more debt universities have from construction, the more they
can add to grants for overhead costs. If a university borrows $100 million to
build a new facility and pays 4% interest, it can increase its indirect rate
by including the $4-million interest payment in the calculation. The building
binge is further fuelled by competition among universities: recruiting senior
faculty members requires space, and lots of it.

Really? There is a tax-clause to fuel real estate borrowing?
