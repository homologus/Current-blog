When, in early 2013, we covered Eran Elhaik's paper on the origin of European
Jewish population, he was treated everywhere like a pariah. Haldane's Sieve
blog, which supposedly posts all interesting pop-gen preprints from arxiv,
completely ignored his paper. Yet, as it turned out over the last 18 months,
Elhaik's paper became the second most well-read among all papers published in
Genome Biology and Evolution, even surpassing ["On the immortality of
television sets: function in the human genome according to the evolution-free
gospel of
ENCODE"](http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2013/02/20/gbe.evt028).
Links from our previous blog posts covering Elhaik's research are given below.

In his blog, Elhaik has written a critic of a new Jewish Genome paper, which
we are cross-posting below.
