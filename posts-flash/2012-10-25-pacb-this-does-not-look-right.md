From yahoo finance:

**Total Cash**: 137M 

**Total cash/share**: 2.46 

**Book value:** 2.66 

Why is stock price below book value or cash/share?

**Full Time Employees:** 326 

If the company spends $200K/employee/year, that is a cash burn of $65M/year.
Those estimates are roughly in line with their [8-K filing from Sept.
2012](http://yahoo.brand.edgar-
online.com/DisplayFiling.aspx?dcn=0001193125-12-435373) and their cash level
is down another ~20M from 137M of June.

I think the market is saying that the company is burning cash too fast, and
market wants to force its hand. The company will have to respond by
drastically reducing R&D; expense.

Big layoffs coming?
