> Motivation: Understanding the occurrence and regulation of alternative
splicing (AS) is a key task towards explaining the regulatory processes that
help to shape the complex transcriptomes of higher eukaryotes. With the advent
of high-throughput sequencing of RNA, the diversity of AS transcripts could be
measured at an unprecedented depth. Although the catalog of known AS events
has ever grown since, novel isoforms are commonly observed when working with
less annotated organisms, in the context of diseases, or within large
populations. Whereas an identification of complete isoforms is technically
challenging or expensive, focussing on single splicing events as a proxy for
transcriptome characteristics is fruitful for differential analyses. Results:
We present SplAdder, an alternative splicing toolbox, that takes RNA-Seq
alignments and an annotation file as input to i) augment the annotation based
on RNA-Seq evidence, ii) identify alternative splicing events present in the
augmented annotation graph, iii) quantify and confirm these events based on
the RNA-Seq data, and iv) test for significant quantitative differences.
