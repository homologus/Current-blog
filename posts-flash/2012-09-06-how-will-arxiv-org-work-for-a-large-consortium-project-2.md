Call us visionaries (or physics drop-out :)), because we tried to introduce
arxiv.org to Honeybee Genome Sequencing Consortium in 2007
([link](http://arxiv.org/abs/q-bio/0702036),
[link](http://arxiv.org/abs/q-bio/0702037)). The time was not ripe, and the
community ignored our efforts.

Here was what we thought would be the potential use of arxiv.org for a large
community project. As explained in [previous
commentary](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/2012/09/06/cb-on-encode-embargo/), we
noticed frictions between various groups, who were collaborators as well as
competitors in the project. They were eager to share information with each
other, but also had fear that they could get scooped by others.

Typically, consortium managers resolve conflicts in such situations by
dividing territories, and asking each group to look into one or other aspect
of the genome. Also, consortium managers designate themselves as the central
hub trying to understand everyone's work.

people were involved in the consortium, and what was it like coordinating such
a massive effort?**

This is very much a different way of doing science. I am only one of 400
investigators, and I am the person who is charged to make sure that the
analysis was delivered and that it all worked out. But I had to draw on the
talents of many, many people.

So Im more like the cat herder, the conductor, necessarily, than someone whose
brain can absorb all of this. It comes back to that sense that its a bit of a
jungle out there.

We thought that was a bit high-school like. Firstly, it is suboptimal to
divide territories. For example, our group was investigating the transcriptome
and we wanted to check the GC-content of regions, where the expressed genes
were located. However, another group was designated to look at the nucleotide-
distribution of the genome and they thought we were stepping on their
territories.

Secondly, having a centralized point of contact means the groups do not share
everything with each other. They talk to one all-knowing person, who figures
out who should talk to whom.

Arxiv.org can dramatically improve the collaborative power of a consortium
project by letting everyone share with each other, and also remove the fear of
getting scooped in the process of sharing.

Needless to say nobody liked our ideas, and we did not bother to join any more
consortium project since 2007.
