Scaffolding is among the most difficult problems in genome assembly.
Hapsembler group has an interesting paper on scaffolding that is worth taking
a look. We have not gone through it yet, but [posting the link
here](http://compbio.cs.toronto.edu/hapsembler/scarpa_paper.pdf) to come back
to the topic in future. Abstract below.

> We present SCARPA, a novel scaffolder which combines fixed-parameter
tractable and bounded algorithms with Linear Programming to produce near-
optimal scaffolds. We test SCARPA on real datasets in addition to a simulated
diploid genome and compare its performance to several state-of-the-art
scaffolders. We show that SCARPA produces longer or similar length scaffolds
that are highly accurate compared to other scaffolders. SCARPA is also capable
of detecting misassembled contigs and reports them during scaffolding.
