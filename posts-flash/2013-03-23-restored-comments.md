This is embarrassing. We were going through our weekly spam-box cleanup and
found that, for some odd reason, our spam software removed a large number of
very good comments on one commentary. We restored all of them and [bumped up
the commentary](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/2013/03/13/bootstrapped-genome-
project-iii-on-mindless-triplicate-experiments/) to the top of page. Many
apologies to our readers for contributing and not finding their comments to
show up.
