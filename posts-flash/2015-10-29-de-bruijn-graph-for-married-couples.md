> We address the problemof enumeration of seating arrangements ofmarried
couples around a circular table such that no spouses seat next to each other
and no k consecutive persons are of the same gender. While the case of k = 2
corresponds to the classical probl`eme des menages with a well-studied
solution, no closed-form expression for number of arrangements is known when
k=3.

We propose a novel approach to this type of problems based on enumeration of
circuits in certain algebraically weighted de Bruijn graphs. Our approach
leads to a new expression for the menage numbers and their exponential
generating function, and allows one to efficiently compute the number of
seating arrangements in general cases. We work out all the details for k = 3.
