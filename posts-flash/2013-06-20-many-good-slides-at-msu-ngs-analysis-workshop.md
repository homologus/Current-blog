It is a pleasure to see genome and transcriptome assembly algorithms covered
extensively in [MSU NGS Analysis
Workshop](http://ged.msu.edu/angus/tutorials-2013/index.html), whereas
assembly algorithms used to the exclusive domains of genome centers in the
earlier days. [We wrote our de Bruijn graph
tutorial](http://www.homolog.us/Tutorials/index.php?p=1.1&s=1) after having
the same realization that next-gen sequencing would break the genome center
model, and make researchers interested into doing actual assemblies.

Rayan Chikhi's slides on "Advanced genome assembly" and "Slightly more
advanced genome assembly" are very informative (click on the image to open
pdf):

We also liked Erich Schwarz's slides on "Genome and transcriptome of the
zoonotic hookworm Ancylostoma ceylanicum" (click on the image to open pdf):

[The workshop website](http://ged.msu.edu/angus/tutorials-2013/index.html)
contains links to many other good slides and tutorials on bioinformatics from
[Istvan Albert of Biostar fame](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/software/),
Michael Crusoe and others.

Those uninterested in bioinformatics will not be disappointed either, because
Titus Brown made sure few cross-disciplinary topics were included in the
website :) -
