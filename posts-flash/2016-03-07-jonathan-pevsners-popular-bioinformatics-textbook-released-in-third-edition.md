The book '[Bioinformatics and Functional
Genomics](http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1118581784.html)'
by [Professor Jonathan Pevsner](http://www.kennedykrieger.org/patient-care
/faculty-staff/jonathan-pevsner) of Johns Hopkins University is packed with
information. Dr. Pevsner not only covers algorithms, but also discusses
various web-based tools for accessing and analyzing data. Given that those
websites change rapidly and some even go obsolete, the author developed a
companion site at [bioinfbook.org](http://bioinfbook.org) to keep track of the
links mentioned in the book.

> This book is organized into three parts. In part I (Chapters 1-7), we
introduce the field of bioinformatics. Topics include access to sequence (and
other) data, pairwise sequence alignment, BLAST and other methods of searching
databases, multiple sequence alignment, and phylogeny. In part II (Chapters
8-14), we discuss functional genomics, moving from DNA (including next-
generation sequencing) to RNA (including RNAseq) to protein. Part III
(Chapters 15-21) describes the tree of life from a genomics perspective,
including chapters on viruses, bacteria and archaea, and the eukaryotes.
Practically, I have used this textbook in teaching two courses: an
introduction to bioinformatics (Chapters 1-14) and a course on genomics in
which we survey the tree of life (Chapters 15-21).

Those interested in learning more about 'Bioinformatics and Functional
Genomics' may take a look at the chapter below, shared by the publisher Wiley
for our readers. Also, you can go over selected pages from the entire book at
