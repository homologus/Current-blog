> Many large noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate chromatin, but the mechanisms
by which they localize to genomic targets remain unexplored. Here, we
investigate the localization mechanisms of the Xist lncRNA during X-chromosome
inactivation (XCI), a paradigm of lncRNA-mediated chromatin regulation. During
the maintenance of XCI, Xist binds broadly across the X-chromosome. During
initiation of XCI, Xist initially transfers to distal regions across the
X-chromosome that are not defined by specific sequences. Instead, Xist
identifies these regions by exploiting the three-dimensional conformation of
the X-chromosome. Xist requires its silencing domain to spread across actively
transcribed regions and thereby access the entire chromosome. This suggests a
model where Xist coats the X-chromosome by searching in three dimensions,
modifying chromosome structure, and spreading to newly accessible locations.
