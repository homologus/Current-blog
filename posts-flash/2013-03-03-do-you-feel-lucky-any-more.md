In Western world, we take few things for granted.

(a) When we enter a room and turn on the switch, there will be light.

(b) When we flush the toilet, drinking quality water will flow through it.

(c) When we type few words in Google search box, the most relevant pages will
show up at the top. Google was so confident about finding the most appropriate
link, they had a 'feeling lucky' button to

No natural law guarantees those three, as we can tell you regarding (a) and
(b) from our experience of growing up in a communist country, and regarding
(c) based on using the internet ten years back. We know that parts of USA and
Europe are taking (a) and maybe (b) to the old days (see

In none of the three tries, Science paper did not come up at the top or even
top 5. Finally we figured out that giving Google fewer options works. Get read
of BGI and 'paper' and you find the paper by BGI. Incredible !!

Not that Google's competitors are doing any better.
