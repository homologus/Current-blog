The thinking of academic community is moving fast in the direction that we
envision. We expect that, in not too distant future, researchers will post
their papers in a web-repository like arxiv.org, write a blog post or two
describing it in simple language, and then tweet a small link to those
familiar with his work. Also, they will continue to write their daily or
weekly thoughts in a blog, so that the paper 'published' in arxiv.org will be
more like stringing together of many blog posts than all new discoveries. We
have not seen any academic researcher go that far yet ([except one or
two](http://www.debtdeflation.com/blogs/)), but a [post in Rafael Irizarry's
blog](http://simplystatistics.org/post/32871552079/should-we-stop-publishing-
peer-reviewed-papers) shows that people are starting to think that way.

**Should we stop publishing peer-reviewed papers?**

Nate Silver, everyones favorite statistician made good, just gave an interview
where he said he thinks many journal articles should be blog posts. I have
been thinking about this same issue for a while now, and Im not the only one.
This is a really interesting post suggesting that although scientific journals
once facilitated dissemination of ideas, they now impede the flow of
information and make it more expensive.

Two recent examples really drove this message home for me. In the first
example, I posted a quick idea called the Leekasso, which led to some
discussion on the blog, has nearly 2,000 page views (a pretty recent number of
downloads for a paper), and has been implemented in software by someone other
than me. If this were one of my papers, it would be one of the more reasonably
high impact papers. The second example is a post I put up about a recent
Nature paper. The authors (who are really good sports) ended up writing to me
to get my critiques. I wrote them out, and they responded. All of this
happened after peer review and informally. All of the interaction also
occurred in email, where no one can see but us.

First we need a paper repository, with full proof back-up and always on
capacity.On top of that repository we will implement a collaborative reviewing
layer. This really is first and foremost a platform enabling users to comment
on papers in the repository.

First about the comments: they should not be text only. We are talking about
rich comments, with pictures, support for latex formula ( la mathjax,
something really easy to use, maybe even offering a GUI of symbols for those
who do not master latex). I believe comments should also include code, data. A
simple way would be to allow users to upload material attached to their
comments. Code is particularly important: it should be treated just like a
paper. Reviewed, tested. Comments can be rated and the most highly rated
comments will be promoted as reviews.There should be a robust system to clean
offending comments, spams, robots. This could actually be managed via user
authentication.

models.html):

I am proposing a new publication model that dissociates dissemination from
evaluation. Its main characteristics are as follows:

Authors post their papers on a repository as soon as they deem them acceptable
for public consumption. Papers can be revised and are given version numbers.
They become immediately citable (examples of such repositaries in math,
physics and social sciences already exist: arXiv.org SSRN,....).

The repository provides a web-based infrastructure with which people can
organize themselves into "Reviewing Entities" (RE), similar to existing
journal editorial boards, conference program committees, special interest
groups, etc. Using this infrastructure, REs can assign reviewers to papers (or
simply give a weight to a review of a paper). An RE may consist of a single
individual. or may be an informal group of people with a common interest (what
we call an "area"), or may be a more traditional editorial board.

Any RE can choose to review any paper at any time (out of the author's
control). The reviews are published and accessible with the paper. Reviews
include the name of the RE. Individual reviewers that are part of an RE may
choose to reveal their identity or not. REs may choose to give a rating or
"seal of approval" to papers they review, so as to bring them to the attention
of the communities they cater to. REs do not "own" papers exclusively, as
traditional journals do, so that multiple REs can give ratings to a single
paper.

However, authors may formally request that a particular RE review their paper.
They may make only one such formal request at a time. The RE is given a short
time to accept or refuse to review (e.g. 2 weeks) and a slightly longer time
before the author is allowed to submit a request to another RE (whether the
requested RE has produced a review or not). RE will have an incentive to
review good papers, as their reputation will increase with the quality of the
papers which they are the first to rate highly.

Reviews are published and are themselves citable documents with the same
status as regular publications. Reviewers may choose to keep their names
hidden or not. Reviews can be given a rating by readers (who are themselves
REs), hence reviewrs will get objectively evaluated and will be assigned a
kind of "karma" that indicates the average usefulness of their reviews (many
sites such as Slashdot and Amazon have such a feature). This will give
reviewers an incentive to do a good job. Eventually, people will indicate
their reviewing karma on their CV.

Papers are under a revision control system. Papers that are revised as a
consequence of a comment or review should cite that comment or review, thereby
giving credit to the reviewer (whether the reviewer was anonymous or not. as
this can be tracked by the system). The citation identifier of a paper
includes its revision number.

Users can set up alerts for all papers approved by their favorite REs.

One can imagine sophisticated credit assignment systems for reviewers and
authors that:

propagate credit down the citation graph, so that you get credit if you paper
is cited by highly-cited papers.

gives karma to reviewers whose evaluation was predictive of the ultimates
success of the paper.

In the meanwhile, academic journals cannot catch a break. Sarah Kendzior came
up with another hard-hitting piece - [Academic paywalls mean publish and peris
h](http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2012/10/20121017558785551.html).

**Academic publishing is structured on exclusivity, and to read them people must shell out an average of $19 per article.**

On July 19, 2011, Aaron Swartz, a computer programmer and activist, was
arrested for downloading 4.8 million academic articles. The articles
constituted nearly the entire catalogue of JSTOR, a scholarly research
database. Universities that want to use JSTOR are charged as much as $50,000
in annual subscription fees.

Individuals who want to use JSTOR must shell out an average of $19 per
article. The academics who write the articles are not paid for their work, nor
are the academics who review it. The only people who profit are the 211
employees of JSTOR.

Swartz thought this was wrong. The paywall, he argued, constituted "private
theft of public culture". It hurt not only the greater public, but also
academics who must "pay money to read the work of their colleagues".

For attempting to make scholarship accessible to people who cannot afford it,
Swartz is facing a $1 million fine and up to 35 years in prison. The severity
of the charges shocked activists fighting for open access publication. But it
shocked academics too, for different reasons.

"Can you imagine if JSTOR was public?" one of my friends in academia wondered.
"That means someone might actually read my article."

The model of journal publishing is broken, because it is impossible to fight
with instant internet access by locking all doors. Also, given that the cost
of electronic publishing is nearly zero with internet technology, the $1000 or
so fee charged by 'open access' journals will not be sustainable. Why not?
Well, there will be ['Chinese
competition'](http://www.gigasciencejournal.com/) to start with !! A [new
open-access journal called GigaScience](http://www.gigasciencejournal.com/)
started with publication fee of what it should be - $0.

Readers may also look at a blog post titled '[Is the Internet the new Bell
Labs?](http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/idea-factory-internet.html)' in C. Titus
Brown's blog along the same line.

> Now, I know I'm a bit of an idealist, but to me this sounds like the way I
and other scientists are using the Internet. I post ideas, they post ideas,
and we interact on those ideas. I think things like arXiv and blogs like
Haldane's Sieve are moving it in the right direction: free exchange of often
rather deep scientific ideas.

Just to follow up this idea, as well as pimp it to those darned Open Access
fanatics... it seems to me that further developing this kind of free exchange
of ideas is what we should be striving for as science moves forward. Not a new
thought, but it does require that we be prepared to engage with what other
people post -- something I'm trying to do more -- and develop good sites like
Haldane's Sieve where we can build fluid communities around our own little
research focus of the moment.

Blog, email, twitter, arxiv.org, etc. are the tools of this new Bell lab, and
'access by fee' journals are not admitted there. Given a chance between
joining the Bell lab and working at an insignificant research facility, which
one will you pick? Or in the language of Steve Jobs (to woo John Scully from
Pepsi):
