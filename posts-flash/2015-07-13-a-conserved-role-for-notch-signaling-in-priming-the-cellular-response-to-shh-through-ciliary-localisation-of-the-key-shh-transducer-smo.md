> Notochord-derived Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) is essential for dorsoventral
patterning of the overlying neural tube. Increasing concentration and duration
of Shh signal induces progenitors to acquire progressively more ventral fates.
We show that Notch signalling augments the response of neuroepithelial cells
to Shh, leading to the induction of higher expression levels of the Shh target
gene Ptch1 and subsequently induction of more ventral cell fates. Furthermore,
we demonstrate that activated Notch1 leads to pronounced accumulation of
Smoothened (Smo) within primary cilia and elevated levels of full-length Gli3.
Finally, we show that Notch activity promotes longer primary cilia both in
vitro and in vivo. Strikingly, these Notch-regulated effects are Shh
independent. These data identify Notch signalling as a novel modulator of Shh
signalling that acts mechanistically via regulation of ciliary localisation of
key components of its transduction machinery.
