Be very scared, when major breakthroughs on [nanopore
sequencing](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/blog/2013/05/16/nanopore-sequencing-
by-divine-intervention/), [stem
cells](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/blog/2013/05/23/human-embryonic-stem-cells-
derived-by-somatic-cell-nuclear-transfer/) and [cold
fusion](http://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1305/1305.3913.pdf) are reported
within the same month. Either human beings have become very creative with
their 80% functional genome, or our planet is very close to alien invasion :)

At least the cold fusion paper did not get fast-tracked to Nature or Cell, and
only reached [arxiv](http://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1305/1305.3913.pdf) so
far. The authors claim that they were able to replicate Andrea Rossi's
controversial cold fusion experiment reported two decades ago.

**Indication of anomalous heat energy production in a reactor device containing hydrogen loaded nickel powder**

> An experimental investigation of possible anomalous heat production in a
special type of reactor tube named E-Cat HT is carried out. The reactor tube
is charged with a small amount of hydrogen loaded nickel powder plus some
additives. The reaction is primarily initiated by heat from resistor coils
inside the reactor tube. Measurement of the produced heat was performed with
high-resolution thermal imaging cameras, recording data every second from the
hot reactor tube. The measurements of electrical power input were performed
with a large bandwidth threephase power analyzer. Data were collected in two
experimental runs lasting 96 and 116 hours, respectively. An anomalous heat
production was indicated in both experiments. The 116-hour experiment also
included a calibration of the experimental set-up without the active charge
present in the E-Cat HT. In this case, no extra heat was generated beyond the
expected heat from the electric input.

Computed volumetric and gravimetric energy densities were found to be far
above those of any known chemical source. Even by the most conservative
assumptions as to the errors in the measurements, the result is still one
order of magnitude greater than conventional energy sources.

A website titled 'shut down rossi' [analyzed their paper line by
line](http://shutdownrossi.com/e-cat-science/thoughts-on-the-latest-andrea-
rossi-giuseppe-levi-and-hanno-essen-paper/) and claim that they are
fraudulent.
