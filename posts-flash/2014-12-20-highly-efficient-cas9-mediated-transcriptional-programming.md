> The RNA-guided bacterial nuclease Cas9 can be reengineered as a programmable
transcription factor by a series of changes to the Cas9 protein in addition to
the fusion of a transcriptional activation domain (AD). However, the modest
levels of gene activation achieved by current Cas9 activators have limited
their potential applications. Here we describe the development of an improved
transcriptional regulator through the rational design of a tripartite
activator, VP64-p65-Rta (VPR), fused to Cas9. We demonstrate its utility in
activating expression of endogenous coding and non-coding genes, targeting
several genes simultaneously and stimulating neuronal differentiation of
induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs).
