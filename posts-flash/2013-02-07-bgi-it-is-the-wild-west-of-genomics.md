> Its the Wild West, says George Church, a professor of genetics at Harvard
University and an adviser to BGI. This is a field that has arisen overnight,
and the number of discoveries is going up exponentially. A single genome
contains a massive amount of data (a human genome, for example, contains about
3 billion nucleotides, or data points), and a bioinformatics experts work
requires sifting through, comparing, and testing the information in multiple
genomes. While sequencing costs have dropped dramatically in the last 10
years, the process is far from automated. Companies that offer personalized
genetic testing, such as 23andMe, typically test only for a sampling of 100
traits and diseases, or about 1/3,000th of the entire genome, Church says. For
about $4,000, BGI does the whole thing.

What next? Are they going IPO Silicon valley style? We hope not !!

Question for readers:

[In an earlier thread](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/2013/02/06/shaking-up-
science/), we said -

> Science in USA has become very hierarchical and people consider authority
more important than scientific process of logical argument.

and reader Damian responded -

> I agree with you, except that I think thats science everywhere in the world.
Academia seems to be becoming a kind of a priesthood.

The posted article about BGI suggests that China is an exception to the above
generalization. Is that true? Does anyone have more direct experience with
scientific culture in China/BGI to filter out reality from promotional writing
? We always try to maintain healthy distrust Business Week :)
