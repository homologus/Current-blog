> High-throughput RNA sequencing allows genome-wide analyses of pre-mRNA
splicing across multiple conditions. However, the increasing number of
available datasets represents a major challenge in terms of time and storage
required for analyses. Here we describe SUPPA, a computational pipeline to
calculate relative inclusion values of alternative splicing events, exploiting
fast transcript quantification of a known annotation. SUPPA provides a fast
and accurate approach to calculate inclusion levels of alternative splicing
events from a large number of samples, thereby facilitating systematic
analyses in the context of large-scale projects using limited computational
resources. SUPPA is available at
https://bitbucket.org/regulatorygenomicsupf/suppa under the MIT license and is
implemented in Python 2.7.
