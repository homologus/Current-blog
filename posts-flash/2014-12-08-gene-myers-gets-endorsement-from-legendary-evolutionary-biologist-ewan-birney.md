> I am looking for a postdoc to work directly with me, Gene Myers, in Dresden,
Germany on algorithms and software for a next-next-gen assembler for long read
sequencers. The required attributes are:

Training and expertise in the area of combinatorial algorithms (e.g. CPM,
WABI, RECOMB)

Great coding skills in C and an interest in algorithm engineering

A desirable additional factor would be direct experience with DNA sequence
assembly algorithms.

My group is at the Max-Planck Institute for Molecular Biology and Genetics in
Dresden, Germany. It is primarily an interdisciplinary algorithms/software
team with a smaller subgroup that builds novel microscopes. See [Myers Lab
Homepage](http://myerslab.mpi-cbg.de/).

As an aside, Ewan Birney, who is [famous for showing 80% of human genome to be
functional](http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2013/02/20/gbe.evt028.
short) (at a cost of $200M) has been following Myers' new efforts with keen
interest. Apparently, Gene Myers plans to assemble a 32Gb genome, which, at
10x size of human genome, could be a $2B opportunity for Birney and ENCODE to
look for 'functional elements'.
