Remember [TPP](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/blog/2013/11/13/tpp-one-assault-

example](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/biology-student-faces-jail-
time-for-publishing-scientist-s-thesis-on-scribd/) of what 'free trade' will
look like after all countries adopt the rules written by multinational
corporations.

> A Colombian biology student is facing up to 8 years in jail and a fine for
sharing a thesis by another scientist on a social network.

Diego Gmez Hoyos posted the 2006 work, about amphibian taxonomy, on Scribd in
2011. An undergraduate at the time, he had hoped that it would help fellow
students with their fieldwork. But two years later, in 2013, he was notified
that the author of the thesis was suing him for violating copyright laws.

The 'why' part is explained in the following paragraph -

> But according to prosecutors, the move was criminal. Colombian copyright law
was reformed in 2006 to meet the stringent copyright protection requirements
of a free trade agreement that the country signed with the United States. Yet
while the US has few criminal penalties for copyright infringement, Colombia
allows only for a few exceptions.
