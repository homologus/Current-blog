Every month, [Seattle Sequencing Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Seattle-
Sequencing-Meetup/) hosts a presentation on cutting edge developments related
to next-gen sequencing. We started attending them since September and the
experience had been rewarding so far. Last month, Michael Rhodes of
[Nanostring](http://www.nanostring.com/) made a fascinating presentation -
"After RNA-seq, Nanostring a tool for digital validation of hundreds of genes
in many samples". We have been familiar with Nanostring technology for the
last 3-4 years, and think the technology is extremely promising.

This month's presentation by [Jay
Shendure](http://www.gs.washington.edu/faculty/shendure.htm) was equally
exciting, because it provided glimpses on where the field is going from a
someone, who is at the bleeding edge of NGS. Jay graciously shared his slides
for our blog readers, and you can download them at [this
link](http://www.homolog.us/download/Jay-Shendure-Seattle-Meetup.pdf). Raw
data from Jay's research can be treasure trove for someone interested in
learning how NGS is being used to find clues about human Mendenlian genetic
disorders. Those data sets are publicly available. From Jay:

> info on accessing the data is in the papers... most through dbGap though
which can be complicated.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22495309

the data for this one is not dbGap and should be accessible through SRA

When we get time, we like to discuss few topics covered by Jay in more
details. In the meanwhile, enjoy this MSM video -
