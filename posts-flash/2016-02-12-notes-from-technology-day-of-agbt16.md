**2\. Long reads**

Pacbio will host a session on long reads today. We will cover the main points
in a later blog post.

Also, our tutorial on analysis of long read sequences will be available to the
members today. Please join [here](http://www.homolog.us/Membership/), if you
work on long read data.

**3\. Jay Flatley's talk**

OmicsOmics blog posted Illumina CEO's talk in storify format
[here](https://storify.com/OmicsOmicsBlog/agbt16-jay-flatley-talk). The
section "Apple Lisa & Bead Express: Examples of new tech not working out" is
interesting. Also, he talked about Grail, Illumina's liquid biopsy venture and
Firefly prep module.

> Flatley: 9 sample system, 3.5h lib prep unattended. Electrode pads in
disposable cart (is this Adv Liq Logic tech?)

JF: digital fluidic library prep, 8 samples in parallel, reagents already
there, library in 3 hrs unattended

Flatley: Second cartridge does clustering, PE steps, 3.5h to 13h run-times.
Driven off wireless iPad #AGBT16

Flatley: 2 modules library prep feeding multiple sequencers. 1G/run, 4M reads,
$100/sample, $30K for both modules

JF: 1G per run, 4M reads, $100 per sample, $30k for machine (library prep and
sequencer)

**4\. Nanopore gossip**
