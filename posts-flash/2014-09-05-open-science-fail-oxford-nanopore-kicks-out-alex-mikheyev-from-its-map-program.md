title: Open Science Fail - Oxford Nanopore Kicks Out Alex Mikheyev from its MAP Program

Yesterday [we wrote about](http://www.homolog.us/blogs/blog/2014/09/04/new-
paper-and-raw-data-a-first-look-at-the-oxford-nanopore-minion-sequencer/) an
initial report titled A first look at the Oxford Nanopore MinION Sequencer.
The author detailed various steps of nanopore sequencing and presented results
from his samples. In twitter, some others criticized his bioinformatics
methods arguing that the alignment tools he used were responsible for his
observation of high percentage of misaligned reads. Thankfully, the author
also uploaded all his raw data on to github for anyone else to check.

We thought that was a triumph of open science, where any apparently incorrect
observation would be quickly corrected by the community. We are yet to see
anyone redoing the alignments with suggested proper procedures, and instead
the saga has taken a different turn. Dr. Mikheyev wrote to us that he was
kicked out of ONT MAP program with the following message.

> We therefore can only conclude that your objectives and outlook are
fundamentally misaligned with those of the MAP programme and the other
participants.

Not sure whether it is intentional, but the message seems to add another
dimension to the 'misalignment' issues. We contacted Oxford Nanopore to
confirm the veracity of the above account, but have not heard back yet.

Edit.

Here are a few clarifications on the above issue, based on relevant twitter
discussions.
