Readers may keep an eye on [#SMRTBFX hashtag on twitter](https://twitter.com/hashtag/SMRTBFX?src=hash) to follow an ongoing conference. This is the best place to know about the latest bioinformatics algorithms on long reads. 

Gene Myers is again the star of the show. He has been distributing a lot of goodies through his [Dazzlerblog](https://dazzlerblog.wordpress.com/), such as -

### dasDAS â€“ The Dagstuhl Assembly Spec

> Jason Chin, Richard Durbin, and myself found ourselves together at a workshop meeting in Dagstuhl Germany at the end of August and hammered out an initial proposal for an assembly format that we think is quite comprehensive and general purpose.


### Mapper damapper 

> Morever, while damapper will run in any reasonable (e.g. 16Gb) amount of memory, it runs faster the more memory there is available.  For example, with 48Gb, damapper is 1.8 times faster than BWA on the human genome, 15 times faster on the fly genome, and 36 times faster on E.Coli.  Performance will be reported on more extensively in a subsequent post.

### Seeing Your Reads: DaViewer

> In brief, DaViewer allows you to view any subset of the information in a given .las file of local alignments computed by the daligner or the forth coming damapper, and any track information associated with the read database(s) that were compared to produce the local alignments (LAs).


We will post other highlights from the meeting by updating this blog post.
